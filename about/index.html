  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>I’m Adam Caudill, a 32 year-old independent security researcher, a software developer, a husband, father, atheist. I’m a lover of fine <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157594276549640/">Japanese Katanas</a>, a collector of <a href="/bayonet-collection/">bayonets</a> and something of a technical elitist.</p>

<p>I started my career in software development, though I’ve always had a passion for security. From the earliest days of my career, it’s been a focus, one that receives far more of my today than it once did.</p>

<p>Much of my time is spent on both writing and breaking software. I live for challenges, so I tend to stay away from the common work (web development, web security, etc.) and focus on things that are a bit more interesting.</p>

<p>In my youth I spent much of my time on <a href="/photo/">photography</a>, even working for a while as a photojournalist - though my schedule leaves little time for this today. While I still love the art and science of photography, it’s a passion that I’ve had to leave behind. While I’ve had to step away from photography, the time working as a photojournalist had a huge impact on me, and journalism has been a topic I care deeply about since then.</p>

<p>If you want more, take a look at my <a href="/resume/">resume</a>; though it’s a bit dated.</p>

<h2>Where to find me…</h2>

<p>I’m active on <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill">Twitter</a>; it’s one of the best ways to reach me. All the code that I can release is on <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill">GitHub</a>, and I try to contribute to other projects as I can. I do have a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamcaudill">LinkedIn</a> account, though rarely use it (and deleted it once before).</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/">Flickr</a>, and even a Facebook account - but I never use it.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to contact me, the best are <a href="/pgp/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Security Research</h2>

<p>While my interest is mainly in communication systems and applied cryptography (I implement, high level designs, I don’t design primitives), I will work on anything that draws my interest.</p>

<p>My work has been cited by many media outlets and publications around the world, from CNN to Wired and countless others.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about the research I do, look at the <a href="/archives/">Archives</a>; while not everything I’ve published is there, most things are.</p>

<h2>Software &amp; Open Source</h2>

<p>While I had toyed with writing code (Apple Basic &amp; the like) for years, I hadn’t worked on anything significant until one day when I was 15 I happened on a copy of Visual Basic 5 Deluxe Learning Edition on sale in a book store; being bored and needing something to occupy my time during the summer, I bought it. That single chance event set the course of the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In the years that followed I focused (almost obsessively) on software development, studying C/C++, COBOL, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Python, and assembly for various processors. While I believe that it’s best to know many languages, to be truly effective you need to know your main languages <em>very</em> well. Today, most of my time is spent with C#, Ruby, and a little Go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a passion for the open source world and have contributed to numerous projects. I’ve served as the project maintainer for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swebs/">SWEBS</a> (a simple, lightweight HTTP server), which had team members spread across the globe, making strong communication skills critical. I&#8217;ve contributed to <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, and various others, plus I <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill">maintain a few projects</a> of my own.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/02/gmail_transparent.png"></p>

<p>Among the applications I&#8217;ve released publicly, GSuite (no longer available) was one of my favorites. It was the first major system-tray based alert for Gmail users that they had new mail (plus a few other useful utilities); released long before it was eventually obsoleted by an official application from Google.</p>

  <p><img src="https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49e14cf9f67c48aad082dec4f106f19a?size=250" class="aligncenter"></p>
  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
