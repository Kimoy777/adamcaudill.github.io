##About Me

* I am passionate about building great things.
* I want to work where my skills are challenged and I can learn new things.
* I don’t believe in giving up or settling for "good enough" – I demand better than that of myself.
* I consider myself extremely lucky to be paid to write and break code; it’s both a hobby and profession for me.
* I spend my evenings listening to podcasts, reading blogs, and keeping up with industry news, so I know I’m up to date, and ready for what’s happening.

##Technology

Code: For the last few years I’ve been working in primarily in C# and VB, before that much of my time was spent with PHP; for personal & open source projects I'm focusing on Ruby. I know my way around C, Java, Python and perhaps a few others, but not well enough to claim any expertise.

Security: I’m very good at breaking things. I understand the attacker’s mentality, and I look at systems with that same approach. I also understand that security is more than just buffer overflows and SQL injection – it’s a way of thinking, it’s a way of designing, it’s about teaching and guiding. Security has to be a thought process before it’ll work as a system process.

Source Control: I’m familiar with Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. I’ve used SourceSafe and CVS, but I’d rather forget those.

Operating systems / software: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu & Backtrack primarily), and OSX. Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop & Dreamweaver, Fiddler, Wireshark, Eclipse. Metasploit, w3af, soapUI, and various other tools.

##Experience

**I am currently** the Application Development Manager at Advanced Call Center Technologies, LLC in Johnson City, TN; I have been with the company since December of 2005. 
I currently manage a team of nine developers, both local and remote.  My responsibilities include:

* Pen-testing applications prior to deployment.
* Ensuring compliance with security standards.
* Designing, and reviewing other developer’s designs for system architectures.
* Mentoring new developers.
* Auditing implementations to ensure compliance with various certifications (PCI-DSS, ISO 27002, SSAE 16), as well as client security policies.
* Designing application architectures and managing implementations.
* Developing applications and tools in C#.

During my time here, I believe I have achieved many things:

* Attitude change to think about quality and security first – instead of "just fix it later."
* Led effort to update applications to be compliant with PCI-DSS.
* Designed a new internal framework that reduced turn-around time by 20% to 30% for large requests and up to 80% for smaller requests.
* Migrated source control away from Visual SourceSafe to Mercurial, and implemented a continuous integration system.
* Standardized data access, security, and other sensitive code into a standard library to improve security and consistency.
* Replaced various third-party communication/integration libraries with fully-managed custom implementations (digital voice recorder, PBX, Avaya dialer).
* Led development of Python/MongoDB system that improved application performance and reduced dependence on Oracle.

**From 2001 to 2005** I worked as an independent contractor and as a co-founder of an ISV. During this time I built a number of interesting systems:

* Custom e-commerce systems in PHP/MySQL.
* Customized ASP/SQL Server commercial e-commerce system.
* Various web sites in PHP/MySQL, some simple; some were effectively custom CMSs.
* Various desktop software (processing tools, RSS client, IRC client, Gmail client, network monitoring, etc.).
* Custom sales system to sell cars on eBay.

During this time I also performed security audits on client sites, provided software and hardware support, and various other IT-related functions.

**From 2000 to 2002** I worked with a now defunct security research group as a volunteer building new tools and scripts to automate pen-testing. These tools were primarily to speed delivery of exploit payloads to identified potential targets and report results.

##Open Source & Community

I blog on security and development related topics, and try to stay engaged with the community via various social services. I was a moderator on what was once the largest forum for Visual Basic developers (XtremeVBTalk.com), and received their highest peer-voted award for knowledge.

I’ve contributed to a number of open source projects, including bbPress, ccsrch, and others. I’ve also managed a few open source projects – the most interesting of which was a fault-tolerant load balancing system for an IRC network that provided much better leveling that DNS round-robin could.

##Education

From 2001 to 2003 I attended Florida Metropolitan University in Melbourne Florida working towards a degree in Computer Information Science. I completed all major-related classes with a 4.0 GPA, and I received multiple Dean’s & President’s List awards during my time there. Unfortunately I did not complete the program due to a family illness.
