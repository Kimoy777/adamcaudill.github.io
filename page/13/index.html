  <div class="entry-content"><p>While testing <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">ccsrch</a> I noticed a number that looked familiar - my debit card number. Now, being just a little paranoid, I don&#8217;t leave such information on my system unencrypted - so seeing it was a real surprise. But, here&#8217;s the real kicker: it was on my work PC, where it never should have been. But there it was, plain as day, in clear text. I spent a couple of minutes staring at the log trying to figure out why it would be there.</p>

<p>Once I saw the file name, a sinking feeling set in and the answer became clear:</p>

<p><code>%LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sync Data\SyncData.sqlite3</code></p>

<p>So it turns out that it&#8217;s Chrome&#8217;s <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=165139">sync</a> feature that was saving my information, but why?</p>

<p>It turns out that auto-fill data is synced with your Google account (if you&#8217;re signed in and have the feature enable, of course), and all of the computers you&#8217;re signed into - and by default, without the benefit of encryption. This file may contain any number of things, from mine I was able to extract the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Full name</p></li>
<li><p>Wife&#8217;s full name</p></li>
<li><p>Date of birth</p></li>
<li><p>Wife&#8217;s date of birth</p></li>
<li><p>Social Security Number</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple credit card numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code">CVV</a>s</p></li>
<li><p>Bank account &amp; routing number</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Not to mention quite a few websites I&#8217;ve been to, various addresses, employer&#8217;s name and other various useful tidbits. All would be quite useful for identity theft or highly targeted <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/april/spearphishing_040109">spear phishing</a>.</p>

<p>Now am I saying that syncing auto-fill is bad? No, not at all. It&#8217;s a very useful time saver, but what takes it from a useful feature to security issue is the fact that by default, this <em>data isn&#8217;t encrypted</em>!</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0905.png" alt="Default Encryption Setting" /></p>

<p><strong>What are the risks?</strong></p>

<p>There are three significant risks I see here:</p>

<p>1). <em>Disclosure to less trusted systems</em>:</p>

<p>In my case, I trust my laptop to be secure; between full-disk encryption (via <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>) and other precautions, I know that I don&#8217;t have too much to worry about. On the other hard, my Work PC is on a corporate domain, and at least a couple dozen people have permissions sufficient to access my personal files - thus I don&#8217;t trust anything too valuable on it.</p>

<p>Now because of the fact that this feature is insecure by default, that data is exposed to a less trusted system.</p>

<p>It can also go the other way: a number of auto-fill entries on my personal laptop were from forms on internal-only applications that only my Work PC would be able to access. So this means that anything sensitive could be leaked to home networks which are typically less secure than corporate environments. If you routinely handle PCI, HIPAA, or other restricted information - this type of leak could be a major issue.</p>

<p>2). <em>Spear Phishing</em>:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a scenario:</p>

<p>You work for a defense contractor and I work for a foreign intelligence agency. Through some targeted attacks I manage to penetrate your home network, but have been unable to make it into your corporate network. I grab the sync database file from your home PC and extract one of your credit card numbers. I look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Issuer_Identification_Numbers">IIN</a> and find out what bank the card is from. Once I have this, I build a PDF with the latest 0day exploit, and send it with a convincing subject line:</p>

<p>&#8220;Important Information about your Bank of America credit card ending in 7850&#8221;</p>

<p>Normally you&#8217;d dismiss it as spam, but the last four digits are right - so you open it, just in case. The exploit kicks in. I&#8217;m in, you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>This is just a simple and quite contrived example, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>3). <em>Google Data Mining</em>:</p>

<p>This is the most paranoid and least likely, but given Google&#8217;s issues in controlling their people - I&#8217;d say not impossible (see <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/05/14/google.admits.collecting.wi.fi.info.with.map.team/">here</a>, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-chrome-page-will-have-pagerank-reduced-due-to-sponsored-posts-106551">here</a>, and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/13/google-fraudulently-solicits-f.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Just for a moment, think about the fact that Google has the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your account data (name, email, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Your auto-fill history (see the list of items I found above)</p></li>
<li><p>Tons of data from their other services</p></li>
<li><p>At least parts of your browsing history, if not much of it</p></li>
<li><p>Engineers that truly enjoy data mining</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most other companies I wouldn&#8217;t worry about; but knowing the people that Google hires, and the skill they have in manipulating data - you know that some engineer is using his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html">20% time</a> to do this (or at least is wishing he could).</p>

<p>If nothing else, I know if I worked at Google - playing with this data would be tons of fun. ;)</p>

<p><strong>Want to see your data?</strong></p>

<p>To see what Chrome has saved about you, download <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/">SQLite Browser</a>, and open the file I mentioned above. Go to the &#8220;Browse Data&#8221; tab, and select the &#8220;metas&#8221; table. What you&#8217;re looking for is in the &#8220;non_unique_name&#8221; column (among other places). You should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0942.png" alt="SQLite Browser" /></p>

<p>The entries starting with &#8220;autofill_entry&#8221; are the ones you are interested in, but you&#8217;ll likely find some of the other records interesting as well. If you see the word &#8220;encrypted&#8221; then your data is already encrypted, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about this.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a vulnerability in Chrome?</strong></p>

<p>No, not at all - though it was a mistake. They should encrypt everything by default, and not provide an option to do otherwise. There&#8217;s no reason to expose users to a potential security risk when there&#8217;s a simple fix. Security isn&#8217;t something users should have to opt-in to; and unless there&#8217;s a very good reason, they shouldn&#8217;t have a way to opt-out.</p>

<p>Google should understand security and the value of the data they hold; they should be more responsible for the data (and faith) people give them.</p>

<p><strong>How do I fix it?</strong></p>

<p>Simple, from the &#8220;wrench&#8221; menu, select Options -> Personal Stuff -> Sign In -> Advanced&#8230; and then under &#8220;Encrypted data types&#8221; select &#8220;Encrypt all synced data&#8221; - and that&#8217;s it. After a couple of minutes the entries that were visible before will now just display the word &#8220;encrypted.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0944.png" alt="Encrypt all data" /></p>

<p>You can also go a step further, and get rid of this data by disabling auto-fill to ensure that potentially sensitive information isn&#8217;t being persisted when it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my employers annual <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI</a> audit, our auditor requested that we perform a search of all of our servers for credit card data. He recommended a tool called &#8220;ccsrch&#8221; - which like many open source projects had a couple of issues, and hadn&#8217;t been updated in years. So, I fixed it.</p>

<p>CCSRCH is a cross-platform, command-line application that reads every file from the starting point passed in, and scans them for what looks like credit card numbers (and using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn algorithm</a> to check each possible result). It&#8217;s fairly brute-force, but it gets the scans required for PCI - though I would be careful about using it during production hours, it can have a pretty significant impact on a server&#8217;s I/O performance.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve forked the application and setup a new <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">ccsrch</a> project over at github (the original is on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccsrch/">SourceForge</a>), and made a few modifications to better suit my needs (from the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch#readme">change log</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Added option to output the file name, and how many hits were found to the console when using -o (see -c in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Added option to limit the number of results from a single file before going on to the next file (see -l in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Added option to exclude certain file types from the scan (see -n in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix for ignoring NULL, CR &amp; LF.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore dash when scanning.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude results with the last 8 digits repeating (very unlikely to be a real PAN).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/downloads">uploaded</a> a Windows build of the new 1.0.5 release to github, and for *nix systems, you can just download the latest <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/tags">tag</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>, while it&#8217;s not likely to be passed as-is, I would be willing to bet money that something SOPA-like will be passed. It may be watered down with many of the most offending parts removed, but for those backing SOPA it&#8217;ll still be a real victory. For them getting it on the books, even in a weakened form means it can be tweaked (and extended) later.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been an amazing resistance to SOPA, from the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/victory-boycott-forces-godaddy-to-drop-its-support-for-sopa.ars">boycott of GoDaddy</a> to public statements from celebrities such as <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/articles/mythbuster-adam-savage-sopa-could-destroy-the-internet-as-we-know-it-6620300">Adam Savage</a> - the public outcry against this horrid piece of legislation has been quite inspiring. But how often will you be able to get so many people to stand up and take action before they start to lose interest? How many times can you raise the troops before the numbers start to dwindle; how long before the celebrities start fearing they&#8217;ll be branded in the media as extremist or crazy? How many times can you raise the call of breaking the internet and freedom of speech before the public gets bored and goes to read about the latest Hollywood divorce instead?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it going:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Strip many of the worst parts of SOPA and get it through congress. By removing these offending pieces, those backing SOPA will try to make themselves look responsive to the community, and it&#8217;ll be played as a victory for the community in the media. All in all, if you aren&#8217;t paying attention it&#8217;ll look like a victory for the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Next year, introduce a bill to modify SOPA to change the wording here are there, edging it just a little closer to the original. If done carefully, it&#8217;ll be easy to dismiss those that try to stir up another outcry as over-reacting or even paranoid.</p></li>
<li><p>In a few years after a series of modifications, we have SOPA, just as broad and dangerous as originally intended - and the vast majority of people who fought SOPA would have no idea.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you have a financial motivation to get something like this passed, they key to success would be patience. Chip away slowly at <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/">DMCA Safe Harbor</a> protections, at what requires a judge instead of an administrative action, at transparency so that any action ends up happening behind closed doors. In enough time you&#8217;ve established a law that gives the US Federal Government a massive amount of control of the internet, without oversight - all in a way designed to get offending web sites off the internet as quickly as possible. To say it would be ripe for abuse would be a massive understatement.</p>

<p>Am I being paranoid? I honestly hope so - I really hope that there aren&#8217;t people out there looking to limit the freedoms we cherish for their own profit, but the fact that SOPA was introduced in the first place makes that hard to believe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PCI DSS, the security standard for companies that handle credit cards, defines a number of <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_audit_procedures_v1-1.pdf">rules</a> as to how credit cards are handled. One of those rules, 3.3, is defined as follows:</p>

<p><em>Mask PAN when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed)</em></p>

<p>So based on this requirement I assumed that the code to do this would be common and widely available; much to my surprise there are rather few samples that do this, and of those I found they only showed the last four (which when you are handling a lot of credit cards, searching for an account by the last four isn&#8217;t all that helpful) and were often rather fragile.</p>

<p>So I whipped this up, hopefully it&#8217;ll be useful to others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I was sent a link to Robert Cringely&#8217;s latest treatise:  <em><a href="http://www.cringely.com/2011/10/the-second-coming-of-java/">The second coming of Java</a></em> - and to say I disagreed was a bit of an understatement. To me, it represents a fundamental flaw in his perception of developers, and more importantly the economics of software development.</p>

<p>The key to Cringely&#8217;s argument comes down to this:</p>

<p>When SSDs gain enough capacity there will be a shift from the Ruby world back to the Java world. Not for prototyping, because, well, it’s prototyping. But simply because the statement “<strong>Ruby is <em>incredibly</em> slow but I don’t care because my database is slower</strong>” will no longer be true.</p>

<p>What he&#8217;s missing here is the real reason people use frameworks like Rails; it&#8217;s not about it being Ruby, or being the latest cool thing - it&#8217;s about developer productivity. That&#8217;s it, and that&#8217;s all there is to it - Rails allows a developer to do more in less time. That&#8217;s one of the key reasons so many Java web developers jumped ship (though I can think of a few others), and what pushed Microsoft to invest so heavily in their <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">MVC framework</a>.</p>

<p>I could fully rehash the argument, but in what I consider to be one of Jeff Atwood&#8217;s best articles,  <em><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/hardware-is-cheap-programmers-are-expensive.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></em>, he covers a key point to my argument - developer time is vastly more expensive than hardware. Atwood&#8217;s take on the issue is clear:</p>

<p>Clearly, <strong>hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive</strong>. Whenever you&#8217;re provided an opportunity to leverage that imbalance, it would be incredibly foolish not to.</p>

<p>When there&#8217;s a choice between developer productivity, and spending money on hardware - the conclusion should be the same. It&#8217;s much cheaper to throw more hardware at a slower framework than it is to invest more developer time in a faster framework. For any non-trivial application, throwing more front-end servers at it will always be cheaper than slowing the development process down with a non-productivity-centric toolkit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple economics; server hardware is getting faster and cheaper, developer time is only getting more expensive.</p>

  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
