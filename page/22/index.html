  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> for quite some time, though as time goes on and updates don&#8217;t come out, it seems less and less attractive. As most web-based services have fully embraced Web 2.o with all its AJAXy goodness, Tasks remains firmly entrenched in Web 1.0; and I&#8217;ve finally given up.</p>

<p>We are in a world where instant is no longer a nice-to-have, but an absolute must. Applications and services should; no, must provide immediate feedback and minimize full page loads whenever possible. Tasks has failed on this front.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>, a simple yet highly customizable task management system. While some things are rather different from Tasks (such as having multiple task lists, and not having nested tasks) for the most part it does everything that Tasks does - only it&#8217;s free (or $25/year for a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/upgrade/">Pro account</a>). With a low price, simple easy to use interface, and plenty of AJAX to keep things moving - it&#8217;s a real winner.</p>

<p>When I started using RTM the biggest issue I had was the lack of nested tasks that I had become so accustomed to in Tasks. The more I use RTM though, I&#8217;m finding that not burying tasks inside of other tasks is actually helping me to get more done, as less is being lost and forgotten about. While seeing all of the tasks laid out in front of me does seem a bit overwhelming at times, I am getting more done.</p>

<p>Overall, RTM helps me get thing done, while wasting as little time as possible managing tasks. Highly recommended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So here we go again - my 4th hosting company since I started this blog. Maybe I&#8217;ll have better luck this time? For those interested, here&#8217;s the rundown of which hosts I&#8217;ve used, and what I&#8217;m doing today.</p>

<p><a href="http://radicalv.com/"><strong>Radical Vision</strong></a><strong> - Lasted 4 years</strong></p>

<p>Radical Vision was once a great host, though as time went on I had more than a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/08/09/hosting-woes-and-down-time/">few issues</a> with them. I tried to give them a chance (several chances, actually). During the first year or so, they were great about updating software and keeping things on the cutting edge - by the end, they were using a known vulnerable version of PHP and behind updates on pretty much every major piece of software in use.</p>

<p>After broken promises and many unanswered support tickets, I decided to close my account, that&#8217;s when the worst came. It took me two months of emails, support tickets, phone calls, and even contacting the company that owned the data center they were located in before I was able to close my account.</p>

<p>As I was fighting to close my account they were bought out by another company, I hope things have gotten better since the buy-out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">HostingRails</a> - Lasted 1 year</strong></p>

<p>After being with a host that was so far behind, HostingRails was a breath of fresh air - everything was cutting edge, latest version of everything. Support was great, servers were nice &amp; fast, really good host.</p>

<p>I was quite happy with them - with one exception: server load. Normally I would expect to see high loads on servers that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling">oversold</a>, but I don&#8217;t think this was the case as the normal load was quite low. The spikes on the other hand, were anything but low - by the time I switched, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing">load</a>) jumping to 20+ and on a few occasions the load exceeded 50!</p>

<p>It may have just been a matter of me being unlucky in having another person on the sever that was abusing the system, but either way it was getting old. I&#8217;d like to do business with them again, though next time I&#8217;ll go <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/vps_hosting">VPS</a> instead of shared.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://servage.net/">Servage</a> - Lasted 6 months</strong></p>

<p>Servage provides budget hosting with a nice set of <a href="http://www.servage.net/page/features/">features</a>, quick support, and a fairly impressive control panel. If you are looking for a low-cost hosting company with a few nice extras - Servage does quite well. Though soon after switching I ran into a familiar issue - server load. While it seems that their web servers are quite fast - the database servers are often bogged down.</p>

<p>After getting yet another database connection error, I decided it was time to look for another option.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html">DreamHost</a> - Current</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard many good things about DreamHost - including from a few start-ups running their projects from the normal shared hosting package. If it&#8217;s good enough for them, should be more than enough for me.</p>

<p>These people have just completely wowed me so far - the best control panel I&#8217;ve used, the most features I&#8217;ve seen from a shared host (especially in this price range), extremely fast servers. The best for me, is the SSH access - as it seems fewer and fewer shared hosts are allowing this type of access.</p>

<p>For now, if you are looking for good, low cost Linux hosting - DreamHost gets my vote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I normally don&#8217;t write posts just to point out an article by another author, but the latest by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> is a must read:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></p>

<p>I point this out because this is something I&#8217;ve been fighting recently. It&#8217;s easier for management to tell the development team to fix a performance issue than to request money for the new hardware that&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>In the long run it would be much cheaper to just throw more hardware at it - though that requires higher level approval. Whereas assigning a couple developers doesn&#8217;t require going nearly as high.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2008/12/07/dell-mini-keyboard-issues/">wrote</a> about some issues I&#8217;ve had with my Dell Mini 9. Since I received my Mini its had issues with the keyboard, primarily that the spacebar wouldn&#8217;t respond. Something I&#8217;ve heard several other people say; leading me to believe it&#8217;s a flaw in the design.</p>

<p>A quick chat with Dell support and a new keyboard was on the way. Shipped FedEx Priority Overnight no less.</p>

<p>I ordered my Mini within hours of it being released, so it&#8217;s a fairly early unit. When I received the new keyboard I was rather disappointed to see the it was marked &#8220;A00&#8221; - which is Dell-speak for version 1.0. So obviously when I saw that, it was a bit frustrating. What&#8217;s the point in replacing a flawed keyboard with another flawed keyboard?</p>

<p>After removing the existing keyboard I found something I really didn&#8217;t expect; the existing keyboard was marked &#8220;A02.&#8221; So my early model Mini has the newer keyboard! So, let&#8217;s take a quick look at what we know so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A00 - This keyboard has the same layout as the A02; the keys are printed a bit darker making it harder to see in low light. The keys are a bit stiffer when you press them, and all the keys seem to respond reliably.</p></li>
<li><p>A01 - I&#8217;ve yet to see any information on this one, though we must assume it exists.</p></li>
<li><p>A02 - This version has brighter printing on the keys though seems to have a defect affecting at least the spacebar and perhaps other keys. Pressing the keys, they feel somewhat cheep or flimsy.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These details are for the US-English, 61 key layout,  Dell part # M958H. There is also an US-International version (U061H) <a href="http://mydellmini.com/forum/replacement-keyboard-more-normal-t1402.html">floating</a> around with a somewhat different layout that some people may prefer.</p>

<p>Though I don&#8217;t like how dark the Aoo keyboard is, it does seem to correct the issue with the keyboard missing presses. The process of changing the keyboard only takes a few minutes and the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins910/en/sm/keyboard.htm#wp1183262">instructions</a> cover everything you need to know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ladies, do you know where your husband is? If he&#8217;s anything like me (or the rest of my team), he&#8217;s at the office. At 4AM. Again.</p>

<p>For the third week in a row I find myself at work at the wee hours of the morning preparing for a project launch. Though today more than ever I find myself asking questions; what takes priority, the needs of a company, or the needs of a relationship? What&#8217;s more important, the health of a project, or my own health? Should I be working to make this project a success, or sleeping to stay healthy?</p>

<p>Normally these questions are simple and obvious - yet so often we choose our projects over ourselves, our companies over our loved ones. Why? Is it the drive for success, the challenge of doing the impossible? Maybe it&#8217;s the money? Why do developers so often sacrifice so much?</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a guide to better managing time, or a treatise on setting priorities; no, it&#8217;s a developer&#8217;s lament. So much is given for a company that does little but ask for more; yet more we always give. We know there are things far more important, but yet so much rides on our efforts, so many people counting on us; how could we dare let them down? Though I appreciate my paycheck, it doesn&#8217;t drive me to do more - it&#8217;s the people, the challenge, the fact only I can make this happen.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, I wish I could bring myself to accept failure; maybe then the pressure wouldn&#8217;t be so great. Maybe then, I could sleep at night.</p>

<p>But this is what we do, we make the miracles; we do the impossible. Every day we face another challenge, every day we find another solution. Now if we could just find a solution for all this time lost from what matters most.</p>
