  <div class="entry-content"><p>I normally don&#8217;t write posts just to point out an article by another author, but the latest by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> is a must read:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></p>

<p>I point this out because this is something I&#8217;ve been fighting recently. It&#8217;s easier for management to tell the development team to fix a performance issue than to request money for the new hardware that&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>In the long run it would be much cheaper to just throw more hardware at it - though that requires higher level approval. Whereas assigning a couple developers doesn&#8217;t require going nearly as high.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2008/12/07/dell-mini-keyboard-issues/">wrote</a> about some issues I&#8217;ve had with my Dell Mini 9. Since I received my Mini its had issues with the keyboard, primarily that the spacebar wouldn&#8217;t respond. Something I&#8217;ve heard several other people say; leading me to believe it&#8217;s a flaw in the design.</p>

<p>A quick chat with Dell support and a new keyboard was on the way. Shipped FedEx Priority Overnight no less.</p>

<p>I ordered my Mini within hours of it being released, so it&#8217;s a fairly early unit. When I received the new keyboard I was rather disappointed to see the it was marked &#8220;A00&#8221; - which is Dell-speak for version 1.0. So obviously when I saw that, it was a bit frustrating. What&#8217;s the point in replacing a flawed keyboard with another flawed keyboard?</p>

<p>After removing the existing keyboard I found something I really didn&#8217;t expect; the existing keyboard was marked &#8220;A02.&#8221; So my early model Mini has the newer keyboard! So, let&#8217;s take a quick look at what we know so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A00 - This keyboard has the same layout as the A02; the keys are printed a bit darker making it harder to see in low light. The keys are a bit stiffer when you press them, and all the keys seem to respond reliably.</p></li>
<li><p>A01 - I&#8217;ve yet to see any information on this one, though we must assume it exists.</p></li>
<li><p>A02 - This version has brighter printing on the keys though seems to have a defect affecting at least the spacebar and perhaps other keys. Pressing the keys, they feel somewhat cheep or flimsy.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These details are for the US-English, 61 key layout,  Dell part # M958H. There is also an US-International version (U061H) <a href="http://mydellmini.com/forum/replacement-keyboard-more-normal-t1402.html">floating</a> around with a somewhat different layout that some people may prefer.</p>

<p>Though I don&#8217;t like how dark the Aoo keyboard is, it does seem to correct the issue with the keyboard missing presses. The process of changing the keyboard only takes a few minutes and the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins910/en/sm/keyboard.htm#wp1183262">instructions</a> cover everything you need to know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ladies, do you know where your husband is? If he&#8217;s anything like me (or the rest of my team), he&#8217;s at the office. At 4AM. Again.</p>

<p>For the third week in a row I find myself at work at the wee hours of the morning preparing for a project launch. Though today more than ever I find myself asking questions; what takes priority, the needs of a company, or the needs of a relationship? What&#8217;s more important, the health of a project, or my own health? Should I be working to make this project a success, or sleeping to stay healthy?</p>

<p>Normally these questions are simple and obvious - yet so often we choose our projects over ourselves, our companies over our loved ones. Why? Is it the drive for success, the challenge of doing the impossible? Maybe it&#8217;s the money? Why do developers so often sacrifice so much?</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a guide to better managing time, or a treatise on setting priorities; no, it&#8217;s a developer&#8217;s lament. So much is given for a company that does little but ask for more; yet more we always give. We know there are things far more important, but yet so much rides on our efforts, so many people counting on us; how could we dare let them down? Though I appreciate my paycheck, it doesn&#8217;t drive me to do more - it&#8217;s the people, the challenge, the fact only I can make this happen.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, I wish I could bring myself to accept failure; maybe then the pressure wouldn&#8217;t be so great. Maybe then, I could sleep at night.</p>

<p>But this is what we do, we make the miracles; we do the impossible. Every day we face another challenge, every day we find another solution. Now if we could just find a solution for all this time lost from what matters most.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So far I love my Dell Mini 9; it&#8217;s a great laptop. Though from the day I received it there&#8217;s been a problem. The space bar.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple but vital key, and very frustrating when it ignores you. There seems to be a common issue on the early Mini&#8217;s with the space bar sometimes ignoring input. Depending on just where you hit the key, it likely won&#8217;t register.</p>

<p>Today I was finally fed up and contacted Dell support. After chatting with a technician for about five minutes he agreed to send me a replacement keyboard. Simple, painless, fast.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a Dell Mini, I&#8217;d advise getting the new keyboard - not only is the space bar issue corrected; but I&#8217;m hearing that a couple keys have been moved to more useful positions.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> See my comment below for the latest updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow! It&#8217;s been over a year since this blog o&#8217; mine has seen any activity, though I&#8217;ve certainly not forgot about it. A lot has happened in the last year, so I&#8217;ll use this post as a bit of an update (and a warm-up for my return to blogging).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to promise you&#8217;ll see a new post daily as was once the case, though I&#8217;ll try to ensure something new is up at least once a week.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/cx7_ext1.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/cx7_ext1-150x150.jpg" alt="Mazda CX-7" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Life</strong> - It&#8217;s been an exciting year; I&#8217;ve moved into a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157603919212651/">new house</a>, now engaged (the big day is in May), and I&#8217;m now driving a <a href="http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&amp;vehicleCode=CX7">Mazda CX-7</a>. There&#8217;s a lot more, but I&#8217;ll not bore you with too many details.</p>

<p>The house is a restored 1880&#8217;s farmhouse that has some great history. Buying a house is an adventure, especially in this market. Scary might be a better word. The only real problem, is much like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1332-rural-internet-stuck-in-the-slow-zone">Jeff&#8217;s</a> (of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> fame), it&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere. My solution for the Internet issue was to sign up for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet">Satellite Internet</a>; it&#8217;s laggy but it works.</p>

<p>The new ride replaced my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157600242021713/">&#8216;07 Jetta</a> (which was a great car), the CX-7 has lots of power (244 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower">HP</a>), full-time all-wheel drive, and a very sporty feel. It&#8217;s a great car, and for a mid-size SUV it does pretty well on fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting</strong> - When I last posted I had been with <a href="http://radicalv.com/">RadicalV</a> for a few weeks shy of four years. When I left they were pretty much falling apart - downtime was common, no support at all, and numerous other issues. Once I moved to the next host, it took them three months to cancel the account and stop billing me. It started out as the best host I&#8217;d ever used, and ended as the worst. My understanding is that the company was sold since then, so hopefully things have improved for their remaining customers.</p>

<p>After leaving RadicalV, I went a fairly new (at the time) host, <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">HostingRails</a>. I was mostly happy with them; great service, reasonable prices, and the very latest of everything. The major downside though was the server loads. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for the load to be so high that it was grinding to a halt. Great service but it seems they are pretty over-sold.</p>

<p>And now? I&#8217;m currently on <a href="http://www.servage.net/">Servage</a> because of its clustered environment and low prices. As time goes on, I&#8217;ll post updates on how this one works out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910-150x150.jpg" alt="Dell Mini 9" /></a>Computers</strong> - My primary laptop has changed from my trusty Acer to the ultra mobile <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-9?cs=19&amp;s=dhs&amp;ref=homepg">Dell Mini 9</a>. At just over two pounds and up to four hours of battery life, it&#8217;s a carry anywhere on the go  type system. It&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the cheapest of the so called netbooks, but with a little work it&#8217;s a great system. I&#8217;m running Windows 2008 Server with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vijaysk/archive/2008/02/11/using-windows-server-2008-as-a-super-desktop-os.aspx">Desktop Experience Pack</a>. When configured correctly, it&#8217;s a killer system.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong> - I&#8217;m still at the same company, though my responsibilities have changed. I&#8217;ve crossed the line into management. I&#8217;ve often heard the joke that managing developers is more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Herding-Cats-Primer-Programmers-Lead/dp/1590590171">herding cats</a> - it&#8217;s quite true.</p>

<p><strong>This Site</strong> - I&#8217;ve upgraded the site to the latest beta release of WordPress, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/11/wordpress-27-beta-3/">2.7 Beta 3</a>. What does this mean for you? Not too much, it did allow me to add a &#8217;<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/tags/">Tags</a>&#8217; page, but most of the changes are behind the scenes. If you have a blog, I <em>highly</em> recommend you upgrade. I upgraded from 2.2 and it was quite painless.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting on management styles and tools and tricks soon.</p>

<p>So, there we go - I think we&#8217;re all caught up now. :)</p>
