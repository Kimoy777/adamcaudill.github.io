  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I saw a post on Facebook by a friend of mine, <a href="http://inotifythoughtschanging.net/blog/">Anthony Green</a>, about writing his first blog post as a Microsoft employee (he has a personal blog as well, unfortunately he&#8217;s not written anything since 2008) - when I saw the title, I couldn&#8217;t believe it was 20 years already - seems just yesterday that I wrote about its <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/27/happy-belated-birthday-vb/">15th birthday</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbteam/archive/2011/05/20/happy-20th-birthday-visual-basic.aspx">Happy 20th Birthday Visual Basic!</a></p>

<p>My, what a journey it&#8217;s been. Almost fifteen years ago I randomly bought a copy of &#8220;Visual Basic 5: Deluxe Learning Edition&#8221; - I was just 15 at the time and wanted a new hobby, and writing software seemed like it would be fun. In those early days, I had no idea what career I would choose, and really didn&#8217;t intend for software development to become the dominant force in my life - I just wanted a better, more productive way to spend my time during the summer.</p>

<p>In the years that have went by, I became passionate about the field, and all it encompasses (possible obsessed, if you believe my wife) - it&#8217;s been the driving force in my life. Today, I manage a team of 6 developers, and have a fun start-up with some friends (that someday won&#8217;t cost me money every month) - and all because I bought that book. Overall, I have a lot to thank VB for, it really did get me started in this field.</p>

<p>Today though, my language of choice has moved on to newer options - I prefer bleeding technologies when I can use them - but VB will always have a place in my heart, and I&#8217;ll always follow its progress as it continues to transform and adapt to an ever-changing world. As the most popular .NET language (contrary to what many of the C# developers think), it plays a vital role in the development of the framework and the ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the conversations I&#8217;ve had with Anthony about the future of the language, I greatly look forward to writing about its 25th birthday; I expect those will be exciting times for the language and the entire .NET ecosystem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier today, a rather surprising tweet hit, being retweeted at least 80 times, including by a few rather influential people in the .NET world:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Microsoft announces to mvps at <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> that VB6 will be released as open source on codeplex end of june! w00t</p>&mdash; Roy Osherove (@RoyOsherove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyOsherove/status/71287262842859520">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s not an announcement that anybody was expecting, but given the talk going on at the time - and the high-profile people talking about it, there wasn&#8217;t much reason to doubt. Announcing a product that has been dead for years is going open source would certainly be a strategy shift for Microsoft, but does it make any sense? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kevindente">Kevin Dente</a> of <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a> fame certainly thought that Microsoft had better things to release:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Instead of VB6 I&#8217;d rather see MS open source IE6. Then at least we could build a standalone version of it.</p>&mdash; Kevin Dente (@kevindente) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevindente/status/71292995185553408">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Shortly after the initial tweet, <a href="http://www.dougseven.com/">Doug Seven</a>, the Director of Product Management, Visual Studio Tools &amp; Languages, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dseven/status/71316722854002688">replied</a> asking Roy Osherove (the original poster) to email him. Hmm, it&#8217;s starting to smell like something odd is going on. A couple of hours later, Doug set the story straight:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>The rumors of VB6 going open source are simply not true. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6rumor">#vb6rumor</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6">#vb6</a></p>&mdash; dseven (@dseven) <a href="https://twitter.com/dseven/status/71352709785198592">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>To which, Roy then tried to unset:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>RT @<a href="https://twitter.com/dseven">dseven</a>: The rumors of VB6 going open source are true. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6rumor">#vb6rumor</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6">#vb6</a></p>&mdash; Roy Osherove (@RoyOsherove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyOsherove/status/71355603611680769">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Roy Osherove currently has a full ten-times the followers that Doug Seven has, meaning his altered retweet was seen by more people (at least initially). For several hours word was going around, and accepted by a number of people who thought Microsoft was actually going to open the code to VB6 (including journalists who were too busy writing articles to do any fact checking) - all based on one person who made it all up.</p>

<p>Lesson here: be careful about what you re-tweet, it&#8217;s easy to endorse a lie as several people unwittingly did today (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/blowdart">@blowdart</a> summed it <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/blowdart/status/71370740934524928">rather well</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my fresh Ubuntu 11.04 box running Ruby 1.9.2 instead of the standard Ruby 1.8, I ran into some undocumented errors while installing the <code>mysql2</code> gem. Here&#8217;s what I was seeing:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install mysql2
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
          &lt;internal:lib/rubygems/custom_require&gt;:29:in `require': 
          no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)
    from &lt;internal:lib/rubygems/custom_require&gt;:29:in `require'
    from extconf.rb:2:in `&lt;main&gt;'


Gem files will remain installed in 
  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.2 for inspection.
Results logged to 
  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.2/ext/mysql2/gem_make.out
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously isn&#8217;t all that helpful, nor did I find anything all that useful on Google - thankfully the issue is easy to solve. All that&#8217;s needed is to ensure that the following packages are installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libmysql-ruby1.9 ruby1.9.1-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can try installing the gem, it should work, hopefully</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a tip for all my Facebook friends, despite the promises you see spreading wildly across Facebook, you can&#8217;t see who&#8217;s looking at your profile. If you ever see anything like this, it&#8217;s a scam - pure and simple:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-05-14_2015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you ever see a page like this, or one that asks you to paste a script into your address bar as this one does, <em>please</em> immediately report the page. If you see any of your friends &#8216;like&#8217; a page like this or send messages linking to something like this, please warn them - they have likely handed their account over to a scammer or other bottom-dwelling script-kiddy.</p>

<p>If you were unfortunate enough to get a message from a friend and believe what it said; your account is in somebody else&#8217;s hands and is being used to spam your friends with a message recommending the same scam to them. Odds are, your account will later be sold to others for spamming - <strong>Facebook accounts are sold</strong> thousands at a time, and last I saw they go for about $3 each, sometimes more if a person has enough friends.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do if this happens to you is <strong>change your password</strong>, check the email address and other information listed on your account, then check all of your permissions, including what applications have access to your account. These people move fast, and they can sell accounts several times over, so don&#8217;t assume once you change your password all will be good - they&#8217;ve probably changed your email address or opened some other means to take your account back so they can keep making money from it.</p>

<p>Be careful and be paranoid, there really are people out to get you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While looking at the reactions to Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2011/may11/05-10CorpNewsPR.mspx">acquisition of Skype</a>, I found one tweet that really stood out:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>How you know you have a PR problem: As soon as you buy popular service X, their userbase starts posting alternatives <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23skype">#skype</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Microsoft">#Microsoft</a></p>&mdash; Ted Han (@knowtheory) <a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory/status/68139224028819456">May 11, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>While many users are busy joking about names (personally my money is on &#8220;Microsoft Live Skype&#8221; - my only hope is that there isn&#8217;t an &#8220;Ultimate Edition&#8221; or &#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman/status/68147795852394496">Unicorn Edition</a>&#8221; tacked to the end of the name) Microsoft has a significant problem, and I really hope they are looking at public reaction. Users are concerned; what will Microsoft do to the brand, and how will the brand and service change - users need to be reassured that what they love about the service won&#8217;t go away.</p>

<p>I use Skype on a daily basis, and for me this brings back memories of AOL&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2109615/">failed</a> acquisition of Nullsoft (the maker of WinAmp) in 1999, which took a great piece of software and a well-respected brand, and rendered it little better than RealPlayer (and don&#8217;t get me started on the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/1998/11/24/technology/aol/">Netscape acquisition</a>). I can see this easily going down the same path; as the brand is diluted and merged with others to help boost their marketing goals, and the software is integrated tightly with other products (creating that tight, but invasive feel that the EU had so many issue with when they did it with IE); they could easily find themselves in the same position that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2007/tc2007101_499889.htm">eBay did back in 2007</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft desperately needs to build their online brand to recover the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/29/microsoft-internet-bloodbath/">billions that they are losing</a>, and I have to assume they see Skype as a key player in this quest; the question is can the keep their newly acquired user-base from jumping ship.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Skype will live or die on technology at this point, I think PR is a far larger issue for them right now.</p>
