  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:zerobin">ZeroBin</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin">code</a>) is a new and interesting piece of software to compete with services such PasteBin - largely in response to PasteBin&#8217;s new aggressiveness in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17544311">removing objectionable posts</a>. For PasteBin, it&#8217;s easy to see why their policy changed - currently they can&#8217;t deny knowledge of what they are hosting, it&#8217;s plain-text and easily scanned (look <a href="http://www.leakedin.com/">at this</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me). ZeroBin on the other hand has taken a very different approach - to not just have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a>, but absolute deniability.</p>

<p>The key to this is that ZeroBin stores pastes and discussions encrypted - and the encryption is performed in the browser, with a browser generated key. This means that the people running the ZeroBin software have no knowledge of what they are storing.</p>

<p>So, if they are asked to remove content, all they can do is remove specific named items - it would be impossible to remove all items that contain specific material (where if PasteBin was to be ordered to remove all items containing credit card numbers, it&#8217;s a realistic possibility). As long as knowledge of the key remains limited - the paste will likely live on, no matter the content.</p>

<p>To make it even better, there are no accounts - so there&#8217;s no way to see what a specific user is posting. With a properly configured server, this could be completely anonymous. With no knowledge of the content, no knowledge of users - it&#8217;s the ultimate in deniability.</p>

<p>I really expect that this technique will become far more common in the future. It allows a much higher level of deniability for hosts and service provider, and greatly restricts the ability of investigators to research the activities of a user or group.</p>

<p>Take a closer look at this, I expect you&#8217;ll see more of this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Intel and various industry partners started talking about &#8220;ultra-books&#8221; as competition against Apple and tablets, I was more than a little skeptical. Ultra-books are small and light weight - but not cheap (average price being around $1,000) and rather underpowered compared to what you can get for the same money with a more traditional laptop (they are basically MacBook Air knock-offs). I had written them off almost as soon as they were announced.</p>

<p>I really expected the ultra-book to be a fad, and a short-lived one at that.</p>

<p>Then came the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OEL86Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcaucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006OEL86Q">HP Folio 13</a> - my desktop recently failed, and since then I&#8217;ve been using my 2+ year old ASUS G73 as my only machine. While the G73 is great - it&#8217;s also massive, hot, and heavy. After parting with my unused camera gear, I acquired a Folio 13 to act as my main laptop, leaving the G73 to play the role of desktop / development machine.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours of getting the Folio 13 it was clear, I was in love.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not quite the love I felt when I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2011/01/02/thoughts-on-the-ipad-from-an-apple-hater/">first found the iPad</a>, but it&#8217;s an amazing machine. Fast, super-light, and the battery goes on forever - it&#8217;s the ideal laptop. With the power of my G73 available anytime via RDP, I think this combination is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a rough overview of the Folio:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel Core i3 / i5**</li>
<li>128GB SSD</li>
<li>4GB RAM</li>
<li>13.3&#8221; 1366x768 display</li>
<li>9 hour battery (so far 7-8 hours seems to be the realistic number)</li>
<li>Brushed aluminum case</li>
<li>3.3lbs</li>
</ul>


<p>Also included are the normal things you would expect, like a web cam, Bluetooth, etc..</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed with what this little thing can do, from large compiles to generating <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> sites, it&#8217;s more capable than I expected. So far it&#8217;s handled everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it - and most taking around the same time as my G73 would (and some taking less, thanks to the Folio&#8217;s SSD).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be doing most of my writing and non-development work on the Folio, and the G73 will still be my go-to system anytime I need Visual Studio or other heavy-weight development tools (though I&#8217;d be willing to bet, it&#8217;ll be via RDP from the Folio more often than not).</p>

<p>Overall: I&#8217;m extremely pleased. It&#8217;s a great device - it has the battery life and portability of a tablet (i.e. an iPad), with the power and flexibility of a traditional laptop.</p>

<p>** The Core i3 version is less expense, and thanks to the lower power consumption, it also stretches the battery life better than the i5 - making it a win-win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might be able to tell from looking, something is different around here.  So what&#8217;s changed?</p>

<p><strong>Octopress</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve switched from WordPress to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>-based blogging platform that generates a completely static site. So there&#8217;s no database, no dynamic code (i.e. PHP), minimal memory footprint (which is great, given my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/04/05/quickpacket-hosting/">recent hosting change</a>) and best of all - it&#8217;s fast and secure. Using Octopress, it greatly reduces the security surface of the server, which means I spend less time worrying about updates and more time writing.</p>

<p>Thanks to the completely static nature of the platform, it&#8217;s extremely fast - it allows the server software to do what it does best: shove bits down the wire, instead of waiting on a database and parsing and executing dynamic code. In the coming days I&#8217;ll be tweaking the server software to optimize for performance, so it should get even faster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the ideal workflow, but so far I think it&#8217;s the right platform for me. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to keep the friction low and spend more time writing.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress</strong></p>

<p>So what about WordPress? I still love the product - in general. It&#8217;s not perfect, and while it&#8217;s easy to get running, it takes effort to make it fast and secure - something most people don&#8217;t do. If you want a full CMS and you&#8217;re willing to do it right, WordPress is a great option.</p>

<p>Personally, there are some frustrations with WordPress that I&#8217;m happy to be rid of - not the least of which is fighting the WordPress editor to maintain code formatting. It&#8217;s little things like this, that has had me looking for better options.</p>

<p>For your average non-developer, something like Octopress has too much friction - as the tag line says, it&#8217;s for hackers. If you aren&#8217;t comfortable with Ruby development, this probably isn&#8217;t the solution for you. If you are, and you want a lightning fast, flexible, and powerful platform - it&#8217;s a great option.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn&#8217;t a comment form - I&#8217;ve went back to not having comments.</p>

<p>While I do greatly appreciate those that have taken the time to leave a comment, comments make up the vast minority of feedback I receive. Twitter, and Facebook are more common - so instead of slowing the site down and wasting my time fighting spam, I&#8217;ll just turn off the comments.</p>

<p>If you have feedback - question, suggestions, anything else - <a href="http://twitter.com/adamcaudill">find me on twitter</a> for the quickest response.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my long tradition of frequent host changes, this site has been moved to yet another host. In the last few years I&#8217;ve used a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/06/13/switching-hosts-again/">number of hosts</a> (and there&#8217;s a couple more not on that list), and this time I&#8217;m taking a bit of a risk - so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how this one works out. I&#8217;ve switched to a company called <a href="https://www.quickpacket.com/">QuickPacket</a>, but this time instead of a fairly beefy VPS, I&#8217;ve went in the opposite direction - absolute minimum.</p>

<p>The new plan is about as minimal as it gets:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>128 MB RAM</p></li>
<li><p>256 MB vSwap</p></li>
<li><p>1 CPU Cores</p></li>
<li><p>20 GB Disk Space</p></li>
<li><p>500 GB Bandwidth</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The upside to this? It&#8217;s only <a href="http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/quickpacket-4-99m-128mb-xen-in-atlanta-ga-san-jose-ca-openvz-also-available/">$15 per year</a>.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m going to focus on caching and optimization to keep this and a few other sites running on such lean resources. In theory WordPress should be able to do it, if it can&#8217;t - I&#8217;ll switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> or something similar.</p>

<p>This should be a fun challenge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>October 28, 2004 is a day I&#8217;ll remember for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I was coding away on the next version of a small product called GSuite that I was building for a tiny (and now nonexistent) software company called Imspire Software. It was a simple tool that provided some goodies for Gmail users, and had a few thousand users (it eventually died as a result of rapid API changes and new tools directly from Google). As I took a break to check my email, I saw something that shocked me:</p>

<p>[The full email is still <a href="http://osvdb.org/ref/11/11176-gsuite.txt">posted</a> over at osvdb, and I make a point to go and look at it and the <a href="http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/11176">details</a> once a year or so - just to remind myself of what can happen.]</p>

<p>As I worked through the somewhat iffy English of the email I was in shock. I instantly understood the issue, I could see the code in my mind. It was written by another developer, and I could remember questioning its security - but I had other things I was supposed to be doing and didn&#8217;t worry about it. What a mistake that was.</p>

<p>I went back to Visual Studio and found the code that caused it all:</p>

<p>Shifting values is obfuscation and little more, it looks like security - it might even smell like security, but it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a false sense of safety, it was a mistake to implement and even more of a mistake to actually use in a consumer product.</p>

<p>While this is only a local information disclosure, and not something far more serious like a remote arbitrary code execution issue - it was still enough to really shake me. I had always considered myself to be a good developer, and part of that is writing secure code. This was many things - but secure isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://lostmon.blogspot.com/">Lostmon</a>, the finder of the issue was courteous enough to give me a couple of days advance notice before making it public. Allowing me plenty of time to get a notice up on the web site, and get the next (fixed) version ready for release. I switched from a glorified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Rijndael</a> - a significant step up I would say.</p>

<p>Was anybody harmed by this issue? I don&#8217;t believe so - it was a relativity minor issue given what was needed to get the password. Was anybody impacted? Most certainly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users: They now wonder if they are secure - did somebody steal their information?</li>
<li>Company: The brand is weakened, less trusted, and questioned more.</li>
<li>Developers: Confidence is lost, self doubts start creeping in.</li>
</ul>


<p>Because of this, every time I release an application I give much more thought to what I&#8217;m exposing and how it could be leveraged in an attack against my users. The only way I&#8217;ll agree to an application release is if I&#8217;m completely certain that I&#8217;m not risking a user&#8217;s security - if there are any unknowns, any doubts, then it&#8217;s not worth the risk. Just that simple.</p>

  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
