  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting up the Android SDK on Windows 7 64bit, with a 64bit JDK / JRE is a bit less straightforward than one would expect, thankfully though the solution is quite simple. There are two settings that need to be adjusted to make this work - otherwise you&#8217;ll get an error indicating that Java can&#8217;t be found.</p>

<p>Step 1: Modify your <code>PATH</code> to include the <code>bin</code> folder of the JRE. Mine looks like this:</p>

<p><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin</code></p>

<p>Step 2: Set the <code>ANDROID_SWT</code> variable (you&#8217;ll probably need to add it) to the <code>\tools\lib\x86_64</code> folder of the Android SDK. Mine looks like this:</p>

<p><code>C:\Android\SDK\tools\lib\x86_64</code></p>

<p>With these two changes, everything seems to work as expected. Why this is required on 64bit but not 32bit I&#8217;m not sure, but this does seem to solve the problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you use MD5 or SHA1 to store passwords? Think they are secure? Think again.</p>

<p>While generic hashing algorithms are certainly better than storing passwords in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hacked/">plain text</a>, it&#8217;s still not as secure as it should be. Users place great trust in us to ensure that their credentials will be secure and treated with the utmost respect; it&#8217;s our responsibility to live up to these expectations.</p>

<p>With the simplicity and speed of these general purpose algorithms, it&#8217;s possible to generate hashes looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science">collisions</a>) (or even the original value) extremely quickly. It&#8217;s this speed that introduces the fatal flaw; with a database dump containing MD5 hashed passwords, with a fairly small investment most could be recovered within a very small amount of time (mere days for a large database).</p>

<p>Many people are moving to bcrypt as a solution. In Coda Hale&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/">How To Safely Store A Password</a>&#8221; he covers this topic in more detail, complete with useful stats and links to implementations in languages from <a href="http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/10/bcrypt-dotnet-strong-password-hashing-for-dotnet-and-mono.ashx">C#</a> to <a href="http://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby">Ruby</a> (even <a href="http://github.com/skarab/erlang-bcrypt">Erlang</a> is represented).</p>

<p>If you are looking for ways to better protect your user&#8217;s data, take a closer look at your password storage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you move on to your next challenge how will those that inherit your code think of you? Noble or notorious, innovator or insane? This is a question that all developers should ask themselves frequently; though too few ever do. You should always write with the assumption that someday a new developer will take over your code, and they will question every decision and assumption you&#8217;ve made. When this happens, what will they think of you?</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m more aware of this because I maintain an internally developed shared library that my company uses in every application; but regardless of the scope of the project you should always assume that someday you will hand the project off. Many developers think little about what happens to their code after it passes on to another; what other developers will have to deal with, or how their efforts will be perceived.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m training a new developer there are a few points I try to reinforce as much as possible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Code is only good if other developers can work on it without extensive training. If it takes days or weeks of introduction to get a new developer up to speed, then you&#8217;ve done something wrong1.</p></li>
<li><p>Clever solutions are no better than an ugly hack if it&#8217;s not clear what you are doing. If the code isn&#8217;t clear then it&#8217;s not maintainable, if it&#8217;s not maintainable then it&#8217;s junk.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume you&#8217;ll be hit by a bus. Always write code with the assumption that you won&#8217;t have the opportunity to cleanly pass the code off to a new maintainer. Never assume that you&#8217;ll have time to come back and clean things up later.</p></li>
<li><p>Always perform design reviews, no matter the size of the project2. Once you have a design in mind, talk it through with a at least two other developers. Just because you think it&#8217;s clean and clear doesn&#8217;t mean that others will see it that way as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent, always. I&#8217;ve seen more projects ruined by people doing things &#8220;their way&#8221; than anything else. Match style and design when working on an existing project. Be careful when adding new techniques, technologies, or methodologies to an existing project; unless you are willing to update the entire code-base, you can easily create a minefield without realizing it.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you want your work to be seen positively after you move on, start thinking about your heirs today. The opinion they have of you will be almost entirely based on what they see in your code - not the stories or memories left behind.</p>

<p>1 - There are always exceptions; these are generalized guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
2 - This includes &#8220;throw away&#8221; projects, many projects that are intended to have a short life end up living far longer than intended. This is the most likely place that your heirs will find code that makes them question the quality of your work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of bbPress for quite some time; I&#8217;ve even contributed code to the project. For those that aren&#8217;t familiar with it, bbPress is an open-source forum system written in PHP. It&#8217;s fast, lightweight, easy to install and even easier to use. It also scales, quite well.</p>

<p>bbPress was originally written to power the support forums WordPress.org, which get quite a bit of traffic. Later, it was released as a separate project. While it doesn&#8217;t have nearly the feature set found in more popular systems such as vBulletin or phpBB; it makes up for it in simplicity. It&#8217;s designed to be conversation-centered, where the clear focus is on what people are saying, not the bells and whistles provided by the software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used it for a couple sites and couldn&#8217;t be more pleased; though now I fear the end may be near.</p>

<p><a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the company behind Wordpress.com (and <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2009/04/talkpress-and-bbpress/">ListPress.com</a>) has <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/future-of-bbpress">committed</a> to supporting the project; though primarily in context to its role in the WordPress world. bbPress as a separate product has so much potential, though it seems Automattic has little interest in this; instead the interest seems to be in making bbPress just another add-on for WordPress.</p>

<p>At one point there was a lot of excitement and interest surrounding bbPress, though for a project like this to succeed you need input from the community, you need an open and fast paced development process. Unfortunately for bbPress, it had no such process. There were people who had the skill, time, and interest to lead the project and make it a success; but they were pushed away and the project was allowed to stagnate.</p>

<p>Today, there is <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2009/12/1-1-feature-poll/">some activity</a> going on, and I&#8217;m glad to see that it won&#8217;t fade away completely; though I see little chance that it will live up to what it could have been. I have a lot of respect for <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and Automattic; they&#8217;re very successful and build great products; but they could have done so much more.</p>

<p>bbPress will go on I&#8217;m sure; though I believe only as a shadow of what it could have been. Though maybe Matt will prove me wrong, I certainly hope so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In December 2002 I made my first purchase from GoDaddy, since then I&#8217;ve spent $1,200 with them. Over the years I&#8217;ve seen them grow up to be a major force both in the registration and web hosting markets; I&#8217;ve also seen them go from lean and efficient to annoying and unfriendly.</p>

<p>Once upon a time GoDaddy had the best prices and the best search of any registrar; unfortunately things often change, and not always for the best. As time went on they added more products and adopted a very &#8220;in your face&#8221; style of marketing. For years I&#8217;ve dismissed the aggressive marketing as the cost of the low prices, but times have changed.</p>

<p>The aggressive marketing style, incredibly difficult to cancel subscriptions, feature <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/10/03/cancel-godaddys-domain-privacy/">lock in</a>, and many other annoyances and issues. And why do I put up with this? It&#8217;s not the low prices, as for many things my current <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">hosting company</a> is far cheaper. I&#8217;m no longer locked, it&#8217;s not that. Loyalty? That it, well, that was it.</p>

<p>After 7 years, and $1,200 - I&#8217;ve started moving my domains over to my hosting company; and so far I couldn&#8217;t be happier. No aggressive marketing, good service, and they don&#8217;t nickel and dime me to death.</p>

<p>Loyalty can be a good thing, but how much is loyalty costing you? Is it worth it?</p>
