  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.langner.com/en/">Ralph Langner</a> recently spoke at TED about his team&#8217;s findings on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>; it&#8217;s a clear (and somewhat scary) insight into the wars of the future. Instead of sending fighters and bombers to take out <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-29/world/iran.cyberattack_1_nuclear-program-bushehr-nuclear-plant-malware?_s=PM:WORLD">Iran&#8217;s nuclear program</a>, as was done in 1981 to eliminate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera">Iraq&#8217;s program</a>, a carefully crafted virus slowly and methodologically damaged or destroyed vital equipment.</p>

<p>How long until this is used as a standard part of &#8216;softening&#8217; a target by taking out key infrastructure (flight systems, power plants, telephone &amp; internet, etc.) before the bombs start to fly?</p>

<p>For those of us that have a professional interest in security, understanding the threats both present and future is simply a necessity.</p>

<p>This is a must watch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On March 11, 2011, Twitter said goodbye to some of it&#8217;s most loyal and passionate users.</p>

<p>In a message on their <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk">Development Talk</a> group entitled &#8221;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a#">consistency and ecosystem opportunities</a>&#8221; - they make their position clear: we no longer need you. To demonstrate this, let me point out a couple quotes that deserve attention:</p>

<p>_Twitter will provide the primary mainstream consumer client experience on phones, computers, and other devices by which millions of people access Twitter content (tweets, trends, profiles, etc.), and send tweets.
_</p>

<p>and this gem:</p>

<p><em>More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.  <strong>The answer is no.</strong></em></p>

<p>Independent, 3rd-party developers have driven the progression of Twitter from an extremely simplistic <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">group SMS</a> service, to a massive and near ubiquitous communications system used by millions of people.  As Twitter fought whales and struggled to keep servers running, outside developers were busy building new and better ways of using the service; now that Twitter has gone mainstream and is doubtlessly looking at revenue options, they&#8217;ve told these passionate users that they are no longer needed. The users that evangelized the service, and promoted it in countless ways, suffering through long stretches of downtime remained loyal and energized, pushing the service to become ever more. Twitter, it seems, has no such loyalty to these champions and flag bearers of the service.</p>

<p>If you want to build an application in the Twitter ecosystem now, you are pushed to the outskirts; building integration as a feature of a separate system (such as <a href="http://instagr.am/">instagram</a>), or building for vertical markets which by definition have a far more limited market potential. This is a dangerous time to be invested in an application that relies too much on Twitter; there&#8217;s no telling what or who they will ban next.</p>

<p>Twitter did make it fairly clear that existing applications can &#8220;continue to serve your user base&#8221; - there was an air of a threat in the statement, and given their willingness to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/18/twitter-suspends-ubermedia-clients-ubertwitter-and-twidroyd-for-violating-policies/">ban a major player</a>, I can&#8217;t help but think that they will be looking for chances to kill off other clients, to further solidify their control of what users see.</p>

<p><em>If you are an existing developer of client apps, you can continue to serve your user base, but we will be holding you to high standards to ensure you do not violate users’ privacy, that you provide consistency in the user experience, and that you rigorously adhere to all areas of our Terms of Service.</em></p>

<p>At best Twitter has alienated passionate users, at worst they have inspired new competition with the goal of being what many of these users wanted Twitter to become, before they shifted their strategy away from the core service, to controlling and enforcing a sub-par user experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While building a new website for a small ISV, I was asked to integrate a forum - should be simple I thought, I&#8217;ll just use WordPress as a CMS and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>. Simple? Not quite.</p>

<p>To make things easier, I used <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/themes/platformpro/">Platform Pro</a> by Pagelines (a great platform IMHO) and so used their &#8220;deep integration&#8221; <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/docs/bbpress-forums">instructions</a> (while they are intended for Platform Pro users, the steps are virtually identical for all other setups). While the setup went quite smoothly, it wasn&#8217;t until it came time to test user registrations that the issue came up: when a new user tried to register they would receive an error stating that &#8220;email is required,&#8221; even if they had entered a valid email address. This effectively made it impossible for users to register, and thus made the forum useless.</p>

<p>After a bit of research, it looks like there is a conflict between newer versions of WordPress (3.0+) and bbPress 1.0.2 (I&#8217;m not sure if older versions have the same issue, but I would assume so). The fix for this is actually quite simple: install a <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/zaerl-wordpress-3-integration/">plugin</a>. The plugin itself is quite simple - containing only around a half-dozen executable lines of code, and works around the issue with a simple hack.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plugin description is rather vague and required a fair bit of research to identify as the fix, and the official documentation makes no reference to the issue or that this plugin can be used as a workaround.</p>

<p>Overall, a simple workaround but a major issue if you don&#8217;t notice that it&#8217;s broke (as is quite easy to do).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently discovered that I had left the changer for my BlackBerry Tour behind (I&#8217;m in the process of moving, and left my changer at the old house), and needed a new one that night. So being late in the evening, my only option was a trip to the local Wal-Mart were I found the typical cheap off-brand charger for a somewhat pricey $15.</p>

<p>Had the quality been better, I wouldn&#8217;t have given it a second thought - but I&#8217;ve purchased a number of those changers in the past and they are poorly made and it never fails that they break within a few months.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011/02/lg420g-114x150.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking around I noticed a Tracfone package on the shelf that included a LG420G phone, a micro-USB wall charger (LG branded), a micro-USB car charger, and some other things (phone case, etc.), and all for <strong><em>$15</em></strong>. So for the same price as the cheap off-brand charger, I could get both a car and wall charger (both of better quality than the off-brand that Wal-Mart sells).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s a better deal to by a cheap pre-paid phone and toss the phone than it is to just buy the charger. Kinda crazy, but true.</p>

<time datetime="2011-01-28T02:47:01-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 28<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had an idea for a small web application, and seeing as I&#8217;ve not spent as much time as I&#8217;ve wanted to using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> - I opted to build it the latest version of Rails. A decision that caused far more grief than I expected.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?485850">Dreamhost&#8217;s</a> PS offering (a managed VPS for those that don&#8217;t know), the seemingly simple task of getting a Rails 3 application up and running is actually quite complex. The root cause of this is that Dreamhost&#8217;s OS image is based on Debian <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/">etch</a>, which was released in April 2009 and has since been replaced; which means etch has become fairly outdated.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the process I used, and so far it seems to be working quite well:</p>

<p><strong>Domain Setup:</strong></p>

<p>When adding your domain to the Dreamhost panel, you&#8217;ll want to enable <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger">Passenger</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-01-28_0048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once your application is uploaded to the server, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a particularly unhelpful error message (something like <code>uninitialized constant Bundler</code>) from Passenger (or perhaps just a 500 error page).</p>

<p><strong>Server Updates:</strong></p>

<p>This is where the work starts, and gets somewhat ugly. As a warning, it&#8217;s quite possible that you could damage your configuration doing this; though thankfully you can <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.reboot&amp;">restore</a> your server to a working state within a few minutes from the Dreamhost panel should something go wrong. You&#8217;ll also need to have an <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.adminusers&amp;">admin user</a> for this task, as much of what needs to be done has to be done as root.</p>

<p>First step: Get your PS up to date; even after performing a restore on my server, there were a number of updates that are available to be installed. So let&#8217;s start off by getting those out of the way.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get past those three commands, the next step is to update SQLite to the latest version, as the version Dreamhost uses is quite old and won&#8217;t work with Rails 3.0 (well, to be accurate it won&#8217;t work with the latest version of sqlite3-ruby, which is the default database provider for Rails 3).</p>

<pre><code>wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
tar zxvf sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
cd sqlite-autoconf-3070400
sudo ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --libdir=/usr/lib
sudo make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t update SQLite you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... yes
checking for rb_proc_arity()... no
checking for sqlite3_initialize()... no
sqlite3-ruby only supports sqlite3 versions 3.6.16+, please upgrade!
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>or if you install the updated version, but don&#8217;t force it to <code>/usr/lib</code> you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... no
sqlite3 is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal' or 'yum
install sqlite3-devel'
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>Once that is taken care of SQLite, the rest is easy.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
</code></pre>

<p>At this point if you visit your new Rails site, it <em>should</em> be working!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve not tested this extensively, and I&#8217;ve no idea if this breaks anything. All I can say for certain, if that all of <em>my</em> sites still work, but your mileage may vary. <Disclaimer /></p></li>
<li><p>I was a fairly early Dreamhost PS adopter, and part way through this process I reset my server to get it back to a clean state. After resetting, I noticed some differences with the behavior of <code>apt-get</code> (404s on <code>update</code> and <code>upgrade</code> are gone), so for other early adopters it may be necessary to perform a reset to get your servers configuration in-sync with the latest official setup.</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#8217;t say for a fact that this is completely necessary, though you&#8217;ll likely need to selectively update a few packages if you skip this step. Also, for me, <code>gem</code> was broken until I ran <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://matthewjlittle.com/">Matt</a> for helping me get this working; troubleshooting the SQLite install was more than a little time consuming.</p></li>
