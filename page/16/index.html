  <div class="entry-content"><p>On March 11, 2011, Twitter said goodbye to some of it&#8217;s most loyal and passionate users.</p>

<p>In a message on their <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk">Development Talk</a> group entitled &#8221;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a#">consistency and ecosystem opportunities</a>&#8221; - they make their position clear: we no longer need you. To demonstrate this, let me point out a couple quotes that deserve attention:</p>

<p>_Twitter will provide the primary mainstream consumer client experience on phones, computers, and other devices by which millions of people access Twitter content (tweets, trends, profiles, etc.), and send tweets.
_</p>

<p>and this gem:</p>

<p><em>More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.  <strong>The answer is no.</strong></em></p>

<p>Independent, 3rd-party developers have driven the progression of Twitter from an extremely simplistic <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">group SMS</a> service, to a massive and near ubiquitous communications system used by millions of people.  As Twitter fought whales and struggled to keep servers running, outside developers were busy building new and better ways of using the service; now that Twitter has gone mainstream and is doubtlessly looking at revenue options, they&#8217;ve told these passionate users that they are no longer needed. The users that evangelized the service, and promoted it in countless ways, suffering through long stretches of downtime remained loyal and energized, pushing the service to become ever more. Twitter, it seems, has no such loyalty to these champions and flag bearers of the service.</p>

<p>If you want to build an application in the Twitter ecosystem now, you are pushed to the outskirts; building integration as a feature of a separate system (such as <a href="http://instagr.am/">instagram</a>), or building for vertical markets which by definition have a far more limited market potential. This is a dangerous time to be invested in an application that relies too much on Twitter; there&#8217;s no telling what or who they will ban next.</p>

<p>Twitter did make it fairly clear that existing applications can &#8220;continue to serve your user base&#8221; - there was an air of a threat in the statement, and given their willingness to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/18/twitter-suspends-ubermedia-clients-ubertwitter-and-twidroyd-for-violating-policies/">ban a major player</a>, I can&#8217;t help but think that they will be looking for chances to kill off other clients, to further solidify their control of what users see.</p>

<p><em>If you are an existing developer of client apps, you can continue to serve your user base, but we will be holding you to high standards to ensure you do not violate users’ privacy, that you provide consistency in the user experience, and that you rigorously adhere to all areas of our Terms of Service.</em></p>

<p>At best Twitter has alienated passionate users, at worst they have inspired new competition with the goal of being what many of these users wanted Twitter to become, before they shifted their strategy away from the core service, to controlling and enforcing a sub-par user experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While building a new website for a small ISV, I was asked to integrate a forum - should be simple I thought, I&#8217;ll just use WordPress as a CMS and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>. Simple? Not quite.</p>

<p>To make things easier, I used <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/themes/platformpro/">Platform Pro</a> by Pagelines (a great platform IMHO) and so used their &#8220;deep integration&#8221; <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/docs/bbpress-forums">instructions</a> (while they are intended for Platform Pro users, the steps are virtually identical for all other setups). While the setup went quite smoothly, it wasn&#8217;t until it came time to test user registrations that the issue came up: when a new user tried to register they would receive an error stating that &#8220;email is required,&#8221; even if they had entered a valid email address. This effectively made it impossible for users to register, and thus made the forum useless.</p>

<p>After a bit of research, it looks like there is a conflict between newer versions of WordPress (3.0+) and bbPress 1.0.2 (I&#8217;m not sure if older versions have the same issue, but I would assume so). The fix for this is actually quite simple: install a <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/zaerl-wordpress-3-integration/">plugin</a>. The plugin itself is quite simple - containing only around a half-dozen executable lines of code, and works around the issue with a simple hack.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plugin description is rather vague and required a fair bit of research to identify as the fix, and the official documentation makes no reference to the issue or that this plugin can be used as a workaround.</p>

<p>Overall, a simple workaround but a major issue if you don&#8217;t notice that it&#8217;s broke (as is quite easy to do).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently discovered that I had left the changer for my BlackBerry Tour behind (I&#8217;m in the process of moving, and left my changer at the old house), and needed a new one that night. So being late in the evening, my only option was a trip to the local Wal-Mart were I found the typical cheap off-brand charger for a somewhat pricey $15.</p>

<p>Had the quality been better, I wouldn&#8217;t have given it a second thought - but I&#8217;ve purchased a number of those changers in the past and they are poorly made and it never fails that they break within a few months.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011/02/lg420g-114x150.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking around I noticed a Tracfone package on the shelf that included a LG420G phone, a micro-USB wall charger (LG branded), a micro-USB car charger, and some other things (phone case, etc.), and all for <strong><em>$15</em></strong>. So for the same price as the cheap off-brand charger, I could get both a car and wall charger (both of better quality than the off-brand that Wal-Mart sells).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s a better deal to by a cheap pre-paid phone and toss the phone than it is to just buy the charger. Kinda crazy, but true.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had an idea for a small web application, and seeing as I&#8217;ve not spent as much time as I&#8217;ve wanted to using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> - I opted to build it the latest version of Rails. A decision that caused far more grief than I expected.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?485850">Dreamhost&#8217;s</a> PS offering (a managed VPS for those that don&#8217;t know), the seemingly simple task of getting a Rails 3 application up and running is actually quite complex. The root cause of this is that Dreamhost&#8217;s OS image is based on Debian <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/">etch</a>, which was released in April 2009 and has since been replaced; which means etch has become fairly outdated.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the process I used, and so far it seems to be working quite well:</p>

<p><strong>Domain Setup:</strong></p>

<p>When adding your domain to the Dreamhost panel, you&#8217;ll want to enable <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger">Passenger</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-01-28_0048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once your application is uploaded to the server, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a particularly unhelpful error message (something like <code>uninitialized constant Bundler</code>) from Passenger (or perhaps just a 500 error page).</p>

<p><strong>Server Updates:</strong></p>

<p>This is where the work starts, and gets somewhat ugly. As a warning, it&#8217;s quite possible that you could damage your configuration doing this; though thankfully you can <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.reboot&amp;">restore</a> your server to a working state within a few minutes from the Dreamhost panel should something go wrong. You&#8217;ll also need to have an <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.adminusers&amp;">admin user</a> for this task, as much of what needs to be done has to be done as root.</p>

<p>First step: Get your PS up to date; even after performing a restore on my server, there were a number of updates that are available to be installed. So let&#8217;s start off by getting those out of the way.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get past those three commands, the next step is to update SQLite to the latest version, as the version Dreamhost uses is quite old and won&#8217;t work with Rails 3.0 (well, to be accurate it won&#8217;t work with the latest version of sqlite3-ruby, which is the default database provider for Rails 3).</p>

<pre><code>wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
tar zxvf sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
cd sqlite-autoconf-3070400
sudo ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --libdir=/usr/lib
sudo make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t update SQLite you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... yes
checking for rb_proc_arity()... no
checking for sqlite3_initialize()... no
sqlite3-ruby only supports sqlite3 versions 3.6.16+, please upgrade!
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>or if you install the updated version, but don&#8217;t force it to <code>/usr/lib</code> you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... no
sqlite3 is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal' or 'yum
install sqlite3-devel'
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>Once that is taken care of SQLite, the rest is easy.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
</code></pre>

<p>At this point if you visit your new Rails site, it <em>should</em> be working!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve not tested this extensively, and I&#8217;ve no idea if this breaks anything. All I can say for certain, if that all of <em>my</em> sites still work, but your mileage may vary. <Disclaimer /></p></li>
<li><p>I was a fairly early Dreamhost PS adopter, and part way through this process I reset my server to get it back to a clean state. After resetting, I noticed some differences with the behavior of <code>apt-get</code> (404s on <code>update</code> and <code>upgrade</code> are gone), so for other early adopters it may be necessary to perform a reset to get your servers configuration in-sync with the latest official setup.</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#8217;t say for a fact that this is completely necessary, though you&#8217;ll likely need to selectively update a few packages if you skip this step. Also, for me, <code>gem</code> was broken until I ran <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://matthewjlittle.com/">Matt</a> for helping me get this working; troubleshooting the SQLite install was more than a little time consuming.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a somewhat (but not entirely) surprising <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">announcement</a>, Google is removing support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a> video from Chrome. This change to their implementation of the often controversial HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is both a major step by Google and a furtherance of the already complicated world of video online.</p>

<p><em>&#8230; To that end, we are changing Chrome’s HTML5  support to make it consistent with the codecs already supported by the open Chromium project. Specifically, we are supporting the WebM (VP8) and Theora video codecs, and will consider adding support for other high-quality open codecs in the future. Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, <strong>support for the codec will be removed</strong> and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies.</em></p>

<p>When Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/19/webm-google-h-264/">released</a> <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> (a royalty-free codec which Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/google-acquires-video-compression-technology-company-on2-for-106-million/">acquired</a> as part of On2), it was clear that the intention was to take on H.264 and with this move there seems little doubt that the gauntlet has been thrown down. Although, now that H.264 has such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/">strong base</a> (it&#8217;s included in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html">Flash</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/29/html5-video.aspx">IE9</a>, Safari, Mobile Safari, and Android), it really makes one wonder if Google has picked a fight that has long since been lost.</p>

<p><strong>So why would Google do this?</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my best guess: Money (specifically, patent licensing).</p>

<p>H.264 is heavily encumbered by numerous patents owned by companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco, and controlled by <a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx">MPEG LA</a>, the consortium charged with turning these patents into profit (<a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avc-att1.pdf">here&#8217;s</a> the 70 page list of patents for those interested). While I&#8217;m sure many people recall that MPEG LA made a very public pledge that H.264 would be <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/mpeg-la-h-264-streaming-will-be-free-forever/">free forever</a>, as is often the case, things aren&#8217;t quite that simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06696465857424753507">Peter Csathy</a> wrote a fairly <a href="http://digitalmediaupdate.blogspot.com/2010/09/think-h264-is-now-royalty-free-think.html">detailed post</a> on the matter, pointing out some key details that many in the media skipped. Here&#8217;s the core of what wasn&#8217;t discussed after the MPEG LA announcement (but should have been):</p>

<p><em>But, you say, MPEG LA recently announced that it will no longer charge royalties for the use of H.264. Yes, it’s true – MPEG LA recently bowed to mounting pressure from, and press surrounding, WebM and announced something that kind of sounds that way. But, I caution you to read the not-too-fine print. H.264 is royalty-free only in one limited case – for Internet video that is delivered free to end users. Read again: <strong><strong>for (1) Internet delivery that is (2) delivered free to end users</strong></strong>. In the words of MPEG LA’s own press release, “Products and services other than [those] continue to be royalty-bearing.”</em></p>

<p><a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s VP of Engineering offer&#8217;s a somewhat similar take in &#8221;<a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/08/27/free-as-in-smokescreen/">Free as in Smokescreen</a>:&#8221;</p>

<p><em>What MPEG-LA announced is that their current moratorium on charging fees for the <strong>transmission of H.264 content</strong>, previously extended through 2015 for uses that don’t charge users, is now permanent. You still have to pay for a license for H.264 if you want to make things that create it, consume it, or your business model for distributing it is direct rather than indirect.</em></p>

<p><em>What they’ve made permanently free is distribution of content that people have already licensed to encode, and will need a license to decode. This is similar to Nikon announcing that they will not charge you if you put your pictures up on Flickr, or HP promising that they will never charge you additionally if you photocopy something that you printed on a LaserJet.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for one of the licensors to reinterpret the license and claim that ads constitute a form of payment or some similar excuse to exclude them from the exception they granted. I&#8217;ve yet to get my hands on the latest licensing agreement to see exactly what it says about this, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to see this card played at some point to wring extra revenue from these patents.</p>

<p>Given that Google owns the massive video sharing site YouTube, which <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html">uses H.264</a>, plus whatever unknown projects relating to <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> - it stands to reason that Google would certainly save some money by moving away from such an encumbered technology; not to mention avoid future risk should rules change. Though personally, I also have to wonder if it could be fears of a repeat of the <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/archives/">GIF patent</a> debacle.</p>

<p><strong>Now where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>Right now HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> is a mess, at best. There is a war for which codec becomes the de facto standard, and there is a <em>lot</em> of money at stake depending on who wins. At this point there is no single codec that works across all major browsers; to get full coverage the best option now looks to be a combination of H.264, WebM, and Flash. Doesn&#8217;t really sound like the progress that was promised with HTML5 does it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting though that Google isn&#8217;t the first browser developer to reject H.264; both <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/01/23/html5-video-and-codecs/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/12/31/re-introducing-video">Opera</a> have decided against including it in their browsers as well. As painful as the fragmentation is now in regard to who supports what, this move by Google actually does little to change the landscape. Support has been fragmented from the beginning, and all this really does it push H.264 a step away from being the de facto standard; a title that it has been very close to seizing.</p>

<p>Had Firefox added support for H.264, I think the fight would be over and would have made today&#8217;s announcement almost suicidal for the project. Though with such a major player holding out against it, Google&#8217;s move becomes a minor tactical shift in the short-term (though the long-term impact could be significant).</p>

<p>I could go on for pages about what works are where we are now, but <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> (an infinitely better writer than I) sums it all up here: &#8221;<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#what-works">Dive into HTML5: Video on the Web</a>&#8221; - well worth reading if you want to really understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>So in summary - video needs to be encoded to multiple formats, which today&#8217;s announcement does little to alter due to the fragmentation that was already in place. In the long run, WebM may be better for the community due to its license, though many of the internet&#8217;s biggest players have a vested interest in H.264. So when you factor in politics and propaganda between competing companies, distrust, and possible patent claims that haven&#8217;t been addressed yet; this all leads me to an even simpler summary:</p>

<p>Yesterday, HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> was a mess; tomorrow it will still be a mess.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><img src="https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49e14cf9f67c48aad082dec4f106f19a?size=250" class="aligncenter"></p>
  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
