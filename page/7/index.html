  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a (fairly quiet) critic of WikiLeaks for a long time, the core of the mission I agree with - information should be free, and should be preserved - but the implementation is deeply flawed. But then, that&#8217;s not really news is it? Two and half years ago when I last wrote about WikiLeaks, I pointed out that <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2010/12/01/wikileaks-biggest-problem-julian-assange/">Julian Assange was the organizations biggest problem</a>. So what do we have today? A grand idea perverted into a political machine, and twisted by ego and delusions of grandeur.</p>

<p>More than two years ago I wrote this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him as WikiLeaks.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today, I would say that perception is correct - WikiLeaks has become an embodiment of Assange&#8217;s personality. In the public&#8217;s perception, the man and the organization have become one; his role as the singular public face of WikiLeaks has clouded the publics vision and diminished the potential of the organization. While the reality maybe different, if the public sees Julian Assange as WikiLeaks - it&#8217;s fate is tied to his.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what we deserve - but it&#8217;s not what we need.</p>

<p><strong>The WikiLeaks We Need</strong></p>

<p>What we need is an organization with many vocal advocates, but no singular leader. What we need is information to be free, and openly accessible to all - a resource for legitimate journalists, unopinionated and apolitical. It should have a governance structure that allows simple leadership changes as needed. We need a resource for repressed information - either secret information from oppressive regimes or by overzealous laws such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/fifteen-years-dmca-abuse">DMCA</a>. There&#8217;s a wealth of information that is being lost while WikiLeaks focuses on political goals and public relations.</p>

<p>What we need is larger than any one person, and thus not tied to their faults or failings - what we need is a mission that&#8217;s bigger than the people involved, bigger than the organization.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it:</p>

<p><em>Governance:</em> The structure should allow members of a governance board to easily come and go; no member should be critical to continued operation. Should a member be unable to serve or potentially become compromised, it&#8217;s critical that their position be transferred with as little organizational impact as possible. All votes, actions, and minutes of the board should be published; the organization should be fully transparent. The governance board should be responsible for certain operational &amp; organizational decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Addition of new members to the board</li>
<li>Addition of &#8216;official&#8217; (i.e. trusted) mirrors</li>
<li>Approval of new content (or delegation to trusted persons)</li>
<li>Control of finances</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Technology:</em> Publishing should be distributed as possible, and use a lightweight front-end to minimize server load. A technology like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> could be used to make as many of the pages static as possible (for security, performance, and cost reduction). Once a site update is released, it should be made available to a set of official mirrors to handle spikes in traffic and help mitigate the impact of a server going offline.</p>

<p><em>Content:</em> As much legitimate information as possible should be published, but care must be taken to avoid publishing false or misleading information, or information that is clearly politically motivated. If there&#8217;s a public perception of political or ideological motivation, then trust is put at risk. Content that is potentially controversial or has potential legal ramifications should be put before a quorum of the governance board to vote on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Content should cover all legitimate repressed information - from highly technical system details so often attacked via the DMCA&#8217;s anti-circumvention clause, to the emails and memos that built WikiLeaks&#8217; early reputation. A hyper-focus on any one topic or type of information causes other valuable information to be ignored, a mistake that must be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Finances:</em> Financial reports should be regularly released to disclose how all donations are used. When money is involved, so is suspicion and mistrust - spending should be extremely conservative and fully documented.</p>

<p><em>Public Relations:</em> While there should be many vocal advocates for both the organization and the mission, there should be no single person that is entrusted with control. The focus should be on the goal - the freedom and preservation of information - not the individuals involved, or even the organization itself; the organization is just to tool, a means to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Will it happen?</strong></p>

<p>What I propose is an organization without ego, without politics, with adherence to a single mission and complete disregard for all other influences. In other words, what I propose is nearly impossible. There are few that believe so strongly in the ideals of freedom and preservation of information that they could be selfless enough to serve on the board of such an organization without letting personal opinions and motivations get in the way.</p>

<p>What I propose would be a haven for whistle-blowers and and those seeking freedom of speech - and no less of a target than WikiLeaks, and perhaps moreso due to expanding the focus to all legitimate information, not just the sole topic that WikiLeaks has adopted in the last couple years.</p>

<p><strong>Someday, maybe&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>We live in a time where information is produced at a nearly incomprehensible rate, and yet far too much of it repressed - by bad laws and worse governments. Without those working tirelessly to make it freely available, it would remain unseen by most, and possibly lost forever. Work always needs to be done, and WikiLeaks as we now know it isn&#8217;t the answer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;or &#8220;Crypto Is Hard, Vol. 479&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier today a tweet about a new feature for <a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-plus/">oclHashcat-plus</a> started a truly interesting debate on Twitter over the implications. The new feature is the ability to crack <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> keychain files - at an impressive <strong>3 million</strong> passwords per second.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Support added to crack 1Password to oclHashcat-plus, 100% computed on GPU! Plus I found an exploitable design flaw <a href="http://t.co/53ZtWggsDz" title="http://hashcat.net/forum/thread-2238.html">hashcat.net/forum/thread-2…</a></p>&mdash; hashcat (@hashcat) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashcat/status/324172122039652355">April 16, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>To achieve this speed, two optimizations were used - the first is in precomputing <code>ipad</code> and <code>opad</code> for SHA1-HMAC, this effectively cuts the number of SHA1 calls in half. This is clever, but not the part I&#8217;m interested in, it&#8217;s the second optimization that I find interesting.</p>

<p>1Password uses AES128, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29">CBC mode</a> to encrypt data - and it&#8217;s the design of CBC that enables the next optimization. If you have the wrong IV when you decrypt in CBC mode it corrupts the first block - but only the first block, the rest will be fine. It&#8217;s this fact that seems to have been overlooked when 1Password was designed.</p>

<p>The final encryption key is derived from the user&#8217;s password via PBKDF2. They generate a 320bit key (so two blocks or four calls to SHA1 after the precompute optimization); of those 320 bits, 128 bits go into the encryption key, another 128 bits go to the IV. For 1Password to work, it needs both the key and the IV - but <em>attackers don&#8217;t</em>.</p>

<p>An attacker can look at later blocks to see if they are valid and ignore the first block, by ignoring the IV generation and the first encrypted block, the number of calls to SHA1 is again cut in half.</p>

<p>To their credit, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpgoldberg">Jeffrey Goldberg</a> of <a href="https://agilebits.com/">AgileBits</a> (the maker of 1Password) responded very quickly and provided details about what they are doing to address it, and joined in a very open discussion about the impact of how this was implemented. Depending on who you ask, this &#8216;flaw&#8217; costs either 1 or 2 bits of entropy.</p>

<p>For the end user, it means that an attacker only needs to perform 50% of the SHA1 calls that the 1Password software needs (maybe only 25%, depending on how optimized the 1Password code is). When it comes to password cracking, that certainly seems less secure than what was intended. As flaws go it could be far worse, but it&#8217;s likely less secure than intended.</p>

<p>And finally, after all of this, we come to the point:</p>

<p><strong>Crypto is hard, even for smart people.</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to accidentally introduce weaknesses like this - everything looks right, but because of how they used PBKDF2 in combination with AES128-CBC, the end result is weaker than was intended. It&#8217;s specific, fairly obscure (to many at least), details of how these two algorithms work, and how they were used together that led to this flaw.</p>

<p>AgileBits has made a lot of good decisions, and in general at least, seems to know what they are doing. I certainly don&#8217;t mean to beat up on them, they&#8217;ve handled this very well and the issue is fairly small. I applaud them for discussing this so openly, it&#8217;s hard to do - I know that from personal experience.</p>

<p>This should serve as a great example of why any new crypto implementation needs to be expert reviewed to make sure that it&#8217;s right. Nobody gets it right every time, every code base needs to be reviewed, this could (but doesn&#8217;t have to) happen to you.</p>

<time datetime="2013-04-13T10:04:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 13<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I received an email from Linode about a possible breach and mandatory password reset that reminded me of another recent email, in some disturbing ways.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Linode customer,</p><p>Linode administrators have discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Linode network.</p></blockquote>


<p>Not too long ago, I received a similar email from Evernote - not just in it&#8217;s text, but in the errors made.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Evernote user, </p><p>Evernote&#8217;s Operations & Security team has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote Service.</p></blockquote>


<p>When I received the email from Evernote, I quickly noticed that the links were to a different site - was it a thinly veiled phishing attempt? With all the links going to <code>links.evernote.mkt5371.com</code> it took a few minutes to work out that the email was actually legitimate. Instead of being able to quickly reset passwords, users were forced to try to figure out if the email was real or not.</p>

<p>When you are sending out a breach notification, it&#8217;s <em>critical</em> that users are able to verify, as quickly as possible, that an email is legitimate, and the the call to action really is necessary. Linode, unfortunately, made a similar mistake.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/Screenshot_4_13_13_10_21_AM.png"></p>

<p>The first thing that jumps out is that it&#8217;s from <code>e2ma.net</code> - not Linode directly, next is that the first link in the email points to <code>e2.ma/message/...</code>. These are immediate red flags, the focus instantly switches from taking necessary action to secure a user&#8217;s account to trying to figure out if they are being attacked. From comments on their <a href="http://blog.linode.com/2013/04/12/security-notice-linode-manager-password-reset/">blog post</a>, I&#8217;m not the only one that was disturbed by how the email was sent.</p>

<p>Thankfully, they didn&#8217;t include a link to the password reset page, and they even told users not to click reset links in unsolicited emails - so it&#8217;s not all bad. Users shouldn&#8217;t be spending time trying to figure out if a notice is real instead of taking steps to secure their accounts. In situations where there may be a significant security issue, service providers should take every effort to minimize confusion - provide clear information, and make the source as clear as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve just spoken to AMI, and received some very important information; so here are the key points and clarifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>To clarify, the &#8216;vendor&#8217; I refer to is a customer of AMI; it is this customer&#8217;s public FTP server that exposed this information.</li>
<li>Per AMI, the signing key included in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive is a <em>default</em> test key; AMI instructs customers to change the key before building for a production environment. It&#8217;s not currently known if the customer was following recommended practices.</li>
<li>The &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; code was unmodified, meaning that the customer had not made any alterations to this specific copy.</li>
</ul>


<p>AMI is preparing a press release. The &#8216;vendor&#8217; still hasn&#8217;t responded (to me or AMI).</p>

<p>Assuming the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions, the private key found on the vendor&#8217;s public FTP server <em>should</em> have little practical value; though how this vendor was handling keys isn&#8217;t known, so the usefulness of the key is also unknown. There is also the possibility of other AMI customers violating AMI&#8217;s instructions. <em>We know we have a key; we don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s been used.</em></p>

<p>Publicly revealing the source code still has some potentially interesting implications, even with the assumption that the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions on key handling. As this code may be under additional scrutiny from researchers, it&#8217;s likely that new flaws will be found that would have been missed otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>A few hours ago I received a call from my frequent research partner, <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a>, about an open FTP server hosted in Taiwan serving up some rather interesting data. Internal emails, various system images (and even the Ghost software!), numerous photos - some personal, some high resolution PCB images, private specification sheets, Excel documents loaded with private information - but that wasn&#8217;t the worst.</p>

<p>In a folder called <code>code</code> was quite a treasure. The source code for different versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Megatrends">American Megatrends</a> (AMI) firmware - but there was even a bonus on top of that! They included their private signing key with the code in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive.</p>

<p><code>308204A30201000282010100ED71D63F21FF0B4563A43D871D22448FC9...</code></p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with how AMI does UEFI firmware upgrades, they were nice enough to produce <a href="http://www.uefi.org/learning_center/UEFI_Plugfest_2012Q1_v3_AMI.pdf">some documentation</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>By leaking this key and the firmware source, it is possible (and simple) for others to create malicious UEFI updates that will be validated &amp; installed for the vendor&#8217;s products that use this &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; firmware. If the vendor used this same key for other products - the impact could be even worse. Even with a quick reaction, odds are users will be unprotected for some time. As users often don&#8217;t install firmware updates unless they are having issues - I expect this one to be around for a while.</p>

<p>This kind of leak is a dream come true for advanced corporate espionage or intelligence operations. The ability to create a nearly undetectable, permanent hole in a system&#8217;s security is an ideal scenario for covert information collection.</p>

<p>This vendor&#8217;s lax (non-existent?) security could have much broader repercussions though. For AMI, they now have a major piece of intellectual property freely available for download by competitors. For users, this code could now be subject to new scrutiny - if a security issue is found in the firmware, it could potentially impact all users whose firmware is based on the leaked code.</p>

<p>If the code was old, as it&#8217;s been when products like <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/symantec-source-code-leaked-on-pirate-bay-7000004765/">Symantec&#8217;s were leaked</a>, this might not be so bad - but it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/Screenshot_4_4_13_10_04_PM.png"></p>

<p>References in the files indicate that the code is from sometime in February 2012 - so this is fairly current code. For AMI, I hope they perform a security audit of their code to make sure that this leak doesn&#8217;t put users at excessive risk.</p>

<p>A foolish oversight now has the potential to impact many.</p>

<time datetime="2013-03-26T21:11:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 26<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Primum non nocere</strong> (first, do no harm) - an iconic phrase in modern medicine, yet also applicable to many other fields. This is something I wish more people would think about, developers especially - and primarily when writing new APIs. In general, developers don&#8217;t have an impressive history with security - quite frankly, developers suck. Seeing as I consider myself a developer, that&#8217;s painful to admit.</p>

<p>Chris Andrè Dale posted an interesting article some time ago that got me thinking: <a href="http://www.securesolutions.no/why-its-easy-being-a-hacker/">Why it&#8217;s easy being a hacker: A SQL injection case study</a> - Chris pointed out the problems with educational material that developers are using, and just how bad the examples are. SQL injection is everywhere and very few examples encourage developers to do it the right way - for that matter, very few are telling developers that there is a right way. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all seen similar issues in other areas, not just for SQL injection.</p>

<p>I had to ask, why? How did we end up in this situation? The industry has come so far in so many ways, it&#8217;s unbelievable that we still have these fundamental issues. It&#8217;s clear that the industry is failing, and these are just a few of the areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educational material is riddled with errors</li>
<li>Authors rarely understand the security implications of their samples</li>
<li>Developers aren&#8217;t taking the time to research the right way to do things</li>
<li>Developers don&#8217;t understand the need to consider security implications</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230;and I could keep going.</p>

<p><strong>Whose fault is it really?</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the PHP/MySQL examples that are floating around, you&#8217;ll notice something interesting: it&#8217;s really, <em>really</em> easy to write bad code. The first examples anyone sees is a simple, one line, easy to understand statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">mysqli_query($link, &quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (&#39;$_POST[firstname]&#39;)&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And this simple command is what people use - with no idea how dangerous it is. The API makes writing bad code easy, but how about good code?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (?)&quot;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;s&quot;, $_POST[firstname]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;execute();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first example is simple and clear, the second is a <em>bit</em> less obvious. The API design itself is leading developers down the wrong path - it supports two syntaxes, one simple and easy to comprehend - but extremely dangerous, and one that&#8217;s more complex, less obvious, but safer. Without understanding the security implications, which syntax do you think developers will pick?</p>

<p>While developers should know more than they do (and I&#8217;m not trying to excuse their ignorance) - the years of effort and the daily reports of SQLi breaches should tell us that trying to educate all of the world&#8217;s developers isn&#8217;t working. As long as the <em>easy way</em> to use an API is the insecure way, we&#8217;ll continue to see a steady stream of breaches.</p>

<p>While I agree with Chris that the documentation is a real issue - the APIs are just as much to blame. <em>Bad APIs make for bad developers</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Secure by default</strong></p>

<p>When a developer is working on a new API, they should ask if they are doing harm with the design. The maxim &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; should be running through their head with each decision. Doing no harm - being secure by default, not leading developers astray - really should be the foremost goal of any API.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on PHP&#8217;s MySQL API here, it&#8217;s just one of many that are designed this way. Look at any API on any platform, odds are better than not that security was an afterthought - if it was given any thought at all.</p>

<p>As anyone who writes code can attest, writing secure code is hard - but when the APIs that developers are given encourage insecure usage, it&#8217;s that much more likely that holes will be found. While organizations like <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a> are making some progress in education and awareness, it&#8217;s obviously not enough. Platforms need to be updated, APIs need to be fixed - this won&#8217;t be a quick process, but we won&#8217;t see real change until the APIs are improved.</p>

  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
