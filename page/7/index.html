  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve just spoken to AMI, and received some very important information; so here are the key points and clarifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>To clarify, the &#8216;vendor&#8217; I refer to is a customer of AMI; it is this customer&#8217;s public FTP server that exposed this information.</li>
<li>Per AMI, the signing key included in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive is a <em>default</em> test key; AMI instructs customers to change the key before building for a production environment. It&#8217;s not currently known if the customer was following recommended practices.</li>
<li>The &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; code was unmodified, meaning that the customer had not made any alterations to this specific copy.</li>
</ul>


<p>AMI is preparing a press release. The &#8216;vendor&#8217; still hasn&#8217;t responded (to me or AMI).</p>

<p>Assuming the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions, the private key found on the vendor&#8217;s public FTP server <em>should</em> have little practical value; though how this vendor was handling keys isn&#8217;t known, so the usefulness of the key is also unknown. There is also the possibility of other AMI customers violating AMI&#8217;s instructions. <em>We know we have a key; we don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s been used.</em></p>

<p>Publicly revealing the source code still has some potentially interesting implications, even with the assumption that the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions on key handling. As this code may be under additional scrutiny from researchers, it&#8217;s likely that new flaws will be found that would have been missed otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>A few hours ago I received a call from my frequent research partner, <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a>, about an open FTP server hosted in Taiwan serving up some rather interesting data. Internal emails, various system images (and even the Ghost software!), numerous photos - some personal, some high resolution PCB images, private specification sheets, Excel documents loaded with private information - but that wasn&#8217;t the worst.</p>

<p>In a folder called <code>code</code> was quite a treasure. The source code for different versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Megatrends">American Megatrends</a> (AMI) firmware - but there was even a bonus on top of that! They included their private signing key with the code in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive.</p>

<p><code>308204A30201000282010100ED71D63F21FF0B4563A43D871D22448FC9...</code></p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with how AMI does UEFI firmware upgrades, they were nice enough to produce <a href="http://www.uefi.org/learning_center/UEFI_Plugfest_2012Q1_v3_AMI.pdf">some documentation</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>By leaking this key and the firmware source, it is possible (and simple) for others to create malicious UEFI updates that will be validated &amp; installed for the vendor&#8217;s products that use this &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; firmware. If the vendor used this same key for other products - the impact could be even worse. Even with a quick reaction, odds are users will be unprotected for some time. As users often don&#8217;t install firmware updates unless they are having issues - I expect this one to be around for a while.</p>

<p>This kind of leak is a dream come true for advanced corporate espionage or intelligence operations. The ability to create a nearly undetectable, permanent hole in a system&#8217;s security is an ideal scenario for covert information collection.</p>

<p>This vendor&#8217;s lax (non-existent?) security could have much broader repercussions though. For AMI, they now have a major piece of intellectual property freely available for download by competitors. For users, this code could now be subject to new scrutiny - if a security issue is found in the firmware, it could potentially impact all users whose firmware is based on the leaked code.</p>

<p>If the code was old, as it&#8217;s been when products like <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/symantec-source-code-leaked-on-pirate-bay-7000004765/">Symantec&#8217;s were leaked</a>, this might not be so bad - but it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/Screenshot_4_4_13_10_04_PM.png"></p>

<p>References in the files indicate that the code is from sometime in February 2012 - so this is fairly current code. For AMI, I hope they perform a security audit of their code to make sure that this leak doesn&#8217;t put users at excessive risk.</p>

<p>A foolish oversight now has the potential to impact many.</p>

<time datetime="2013-03-26T21:11:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 26<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Primum non nocere</strong> (first, do no harm) - an iconic phrase in modern medicine, yet also applicable to many other fields. This is something I wish more people would think about, developers especially - and primarily when writing new APIs. In general, developers don&#8217;t have an impressive history with security - quite frankly, developers suck. Seeing as I consider myself a developer, that&#8217;s painful to admit.</p>

<p>Chris Andr√® Dale posted an interesting article some time ago that got me thinking: <a href="http://www.securesolutions.no/why-its-easy-being-a-hacker/">Why it&#8217;s easy being a hacker: A SQL injection case study</a> - Chris pointed out the problems with educational material that developers are using, and just how bad the examples are. SQL injection is everywhere and very few examples encourage developers to do it the right way - for that matter, very few are telling developers that there is a right way. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all seen similar issues in other areas, not just for SQL injection.</p>

<p>I had to ask, why? How did we end up in this situation? The industry has come so far in so many ways, it&#8217;s unbelievable that we still have these fundamental issues. It&#8217;s clear that the industry is failing, and these are just a few of the areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educational material is riddled with errors</li>
<li>Authors rarely understand the security implications of their samples</li>
<li>Developers aren&#8217;t taking the time to research the right way to do things</li>
<li>Developers don&#8217;t understand the need to consider security implications</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230;and I could keep going.</p>

<p><strong>Whose fault is it really?</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the PHP/MySQL examples that are floating around, you&#8217;ll notice something interesting: it&#8217;s really, <em>really</em> easy to write bad code. The first examples anyone sees is a simple, one line, easy to understand statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">mysqli_query($link, &quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (&#39;$_POST[firstname]&#39;)&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And this simple command is what people use - with no idea how dangerous it is. The API makes writing bad code easy, but how about good code?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (?)&quot;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;s&quot;, $_POST[firstname]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;execute();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first example is simple and clear, the second is a <em>bit</em> less obvious. The API design itself is leading developers down the wrong path - it supports two syntaxes, one simple and easy to comprehend - but extremely dangerous, and one that&#8217;s more complex, less obvious, but safer. Without understanding the security implications, which syntax do you think developers will pick?</p>

<p>While developers should know more than they do (and I&#8217;m not trying to excuse their ignorance) - the years of effort and the daily reports of SQLi breaches should tell us that trying to educate all of the world&#8217;s developers isn&#8217;t working. As long as the <em>easy way</em> to use an API is the insecure way, we&#8217;ll continue to see a steady stream of breaches.</p>

<p>While I agree with Chris that the documentation is a real issue - the APIs are just as much to blame. <em>Bad APIs make for bad developers</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Secure by default</strong></p>

<p>When a developer is working on a new API, they should ask if they are doing harm with the design. The maxim &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; should be running through their head with each decision. Doing no harm - being secure by default, not leading developers astray - really should be the foremost goal of any API.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on PHP&#8217;s MySQL API here, it&#8217;s just one of many that are designed this way. Look at any API on any platform, odds are better than not that security was an afterthought - if it was given any thought at all.</p>

<p>As anyone who writes code can attest, writing secure code is hard - but when the APIs that developers are given encourage insecure usage, it&#8217;s that much more likely that holes will be found. While organizations like <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a> are making some progress in education and awareness, it&#8217;s obviously not enough. Platforms need to be updated, APIs need to be fixed - this won&#8217;t be a quick process, but we won&#8217;t see real change until the APIs are improved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(Update: See <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/critics-substandard-crypto-needlessly-puts-evernote-accounts-at-risk/">here</a> for more information about what they did wrong, including a vulnerability I found in the password handling of the Android app.)</em></p>

<p>So the big news today is <a href="http://evernote.com/corp/news/password_reset.php">Evernote being popped</a>; with 50m users and user base that often stores sensitive material - it certainly is a tempting target for many reasons.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Important: Evernote just implemented a service-wide password reset. Please read our post for details and instructions <a href="http://t.co/4LQABJBYnJ" title="http://ow.ly/icT02">ow.ly/icT02</a></p>&mdash; evernote (@evernote) <a href="https://twitter.com/evernote/status/307882426129055744">March 2, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>CNET was able to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57572212-83/online-note-service-evernote-latest-firm-to-get-hacked/">get a quote</a> from Evernote on the issue, providing some extra insight compared to what&#8217;s in their announcement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our operations and security team caught this at what we believe to be the beginning stages of a sophisticated attack. They are continuing to investigate the details. We believe this activity follows a similar pattern of the many high profile attacks on other Internet-based companies that have taken place over the last several weeks.</p><footer><strong>Evernote Representative</strong> <cite>CNET</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>But there&#8217;s plenty being written about the hack - what I&#8217;m more interested in is the response. Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s happened (publicly, at least):</p>

<p><em>Feb 28th:</em> Evernote&#8217;s Operations &amp; Security team notices potentially malicious activity.</p>

<p><em>This Morning:</em> User&#8217;s started noticing that the client stopped syncing, complaining of a password issue. If a user logs into the web interface, they are prompted to set a new password.</p>

<p><em>10:57AM EST:</em> Evernote posted a blog post and linked to it on Twitter (see above); within a few minutes their blog was returning a database connection error. Later visiting the blog returned a maintenance page, a database error, or a 503 error.</p>

<p><em>11:57AM EST:</em> Evernote posted a new link and redirected the original blog post.</p>

<p><em>1:45PM EST:</em> Received email notifying of incident and password reset. As this email was sent to ~50m users, it&#8217;s to be expected that there&#8217;s a large window during which users received it.</p>

<p><em>What&#8217;s not happened yet:</em> Despite several requests from different people, they have yet to release any technical information on how the passwords were stored, beyond that they were hashed &amp; salted.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s Right &amp; What&#8217;s Wrong</strong></p>

<p><em>Two days from finding issue to notifying users</em> - I&#8217;ve seen some people complain about this delay, but given that the priority is stopping the attack first, and the need to capture evidence as quickly as possible to give the best chance of understanding just what happened - I&#8217;d call this quite reasonable. Compared to some other companies that waited weeks or even months, I&#8217;d say they got this one right.</p>

<p><em>User notification</em> - This is a hard one, on one hand you have the need to secure accounts as soon as possible while on the other, is letting users know why they are being required to change their password. I wish they had been able to get the email notification out sooner, but it was more important that they secure the accounts.</p>

<p>Because of the delay in notifying users, it&#8217;s possible for some users to change their password and go on with their day without knowing why they needed to change the password - or that if they use that same password elsewhere it needs to be changed there as well. They should have made what happened clear when changing the password.</p>

<p>Now, the email itself deserves to be called out - it&#8217;s known that the email addresses where in the stolen data, so emails claiming to be from Evernote require an extra look to make sure they aren&#8217;t phishing. Evernote, to add to the confusion, made a huge mistake: the links in the email don&#8217;t go to <code>evernote.com</code> - they go to <code>links.evernote.mkt5371.com/ctt?...</code>. That raises a few red flags&#8230;</p>

<p><em>The blog post</em> - I love WordPress, but it&#8217;s not always the best choice when you are expecting <em>lots</em> of traffic. They really should have hosted the notice from a static page from the beginning instead of trying to keep WordPress up under that much pressure.</p>

<p><em>The password reset process</em> - To reset the password, all you had to do was login with the existing password to the web site - the same password that was just stolen. No proof of identity at all. If the attackers were able to crack the hashed passwords, they could easily change the password themselves and access the account.</p>

<p>This really should have been done better.</p>

<p><em>Disclosing technical details of password storage</em> - As I stated above, this hasn&#8217;t happened despite numerous requests. While researchers need to know this to understand the risks of the passwords being cracked, unfortunately it&#8217;s possible that this information could help the attackers if they weren&#8217;t able to acquire source code that reveals the inner workings of their password handling.</p>

<p>For example, if the attack vector was SQL injection, it&#8217;s possible to exfiltrate the data without being able to get to code.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>It seems that they have handled this responsibly as possible; this isn&#8217;t the kind of event anybody is truly prepared for. Could it have been done better? Yes, in a few ways - but they could have done so much worse.</p>

<p>It could be argued that in the grand scheme, <a href="http://markpercival.us/post/44391805072/evernote-doesnt-really-care-about-security">they don&#8217;t care about security</a> - from my experience, that&#8217;s the impression I&#8217;ve gotten.</p>

<time datetime="2012-12-31T17:41:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 31<span>st</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://www.snapchat.com">Shapchat</a> has increased in popularity, I&#8217;ve been asked several times to revisit my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/06/16/snapchat-api-and-security/">Snapchat API &amp; Security</a> post, to address the changes that they made in response to my complaints. So, here is it - sorta.</p>

<p>I started making detailed notes and looking at the changes they made - but yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/tlack">@tlack</a> made that mostly irrelevant with his release of <a href="https://github.com/tlack/snaphax">Snaphax</a>, a PHP library to interact with the undocumented Shapchat API. So for now, if you want to know more about their API or if you just want to save images or video - I&#8217;d suggest taking a good look at the Snaphax code. What I will do though, is talk about some of their changes and what they did right and what they did wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Retrieving images is now destructive&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>In the previous API version, you could request the same image from the <code>blob</code> API any number of times, until <code>ss_pa</code> was called to delete the image from the Snapchat servers (which occurred only after the image was viewed, opening a window to save the image before viewing it in the application) - the new <code>ph/blob</code> API removes the image once it&#8217;s been delivered to the client. Without the ability to pull the image multiple times, &#8216;downloader&#8217; tools are far less attractive - instead, to consistently download the media, users will need full replacement clients. This extra bit of inconvenience is probably one of the most effective deterrents against lazy attackers (likely the most common scenario).</p>

<p><strong>ECB mode, really?!?!</strong></p>

<p>Media is encrypted when it&#8217;s sent to the client - this makes it harder to capture data via a MiTM attack, and makes it slightly more complicated to build alternate clients. But, there are a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The media is encrypted with AES, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29">ECB mode</a> - I can&#8217;t imagine how they made such a mistake.</li>
<li>Media is decrypted before going into the cache, instead of when it needs to be displayed - allowing it to be accesses on rooted devices.</li>
<li>A single, hard-coded key (<code>M02cnQ51Ji97vwT4</code>) is used to encrypt the data.</li>
</ul>


<p>Pretty much everything here could have been done better; some of the problems are just simple mistakes, others a result of ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>Security by obscurity&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>When looking at the traffic that the application generates, one of the first things you notice is the new <code>req_token</code> field - at first glance it looks like a SHA-256 hash (and has been mistaken for one more than once), but it&#8217;s not - it&#8217;s two SHA-256 hashes that have been merged in a specific pattern. All of the data to generate this token is already included in most requests (path, timestamp, auth token), but the secret to generating it is the algorithm used to merge them into one.</p>

<p>Prior to @tlack&#8217;s work, this token has been a stumbling block to those attempting to unravel the API - only because of the obscurity of their custom merger algorithm. Now that there is code that demonstrates how this works - the security benefit of the <code>req_token</code> has been completely eliminated. When you rely on the secrecy of an algorithm, it will bite you.</p>

<p><strong>Doing it right&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Making a product like this work is quite easy - making it work right is extremely hard. Snapchat has entered a business where at least some of their users place an extreme amount of trust in them - a failure of their security could have a profound impact on their users lives. Any company that is in the business of handling very private communications is held to a higher standard - and Snapchat is no exception. Security should be the top priority when working on a product like this - and when you see such blatant mistakes as using ECB mode encryption, it&#8217;s obvious that they don&#8217;t take it seriously enough.</p>

<p>Snapchat needs to hire an outside security consultant to review their systems to identify the flaws such as those I&#8217;ve pointed out and provide real solutions - and they have the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-raising-8-million-from-instagram-backers-2012-12">money</a> to do it. Until they do, there will continue to be these cat and mouse games - and they&#8217;ll lose every time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On August 28th ElcomSoft <a href="http://blog.crackpassword.com/2012/08/upek-fingerprint-readers-a-huge-security-hole/">announced</a> that they had determined a method to extract Windows passwords from the registry for users of UPEK&#8217;s fingerprint readers and Protector Suite software (UPEK is now owned by AuthenTec, which is now owned by Apple). What they didn&#8217;t announce was the technical details of how they did it. Myself and <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> have been working to recreate their research - and we have.</p>

<p>We have not been in contact with ElcomSoft, so this is an independent re-discovery of this vulnerability. ElcomSoft has committed to not release details, which I understand - but given how likely it is that others will determine this technique, I believe that this information should be available to pen-testers and auditors so that these insecure credentials can be identified.</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>ElcomSoft blasted the security of UPEK&#8217;s product, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>we found that your Windows account passwords are stored in Windows registry almost in plain text, barely scrambled but not encrypted</p></blockquote>


<p></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t quite accurate - but certainly close enough. The data is stored in the following location (varies by version):</p>

<p><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Virtual Token\Passport\4.0\Passport\&lt;user&gt;\ExData</code></p>

<p>The first 24 bytes are header and size information, after the encrypted data there is a 4 byte number that indicates the number of bytes in the next section, the following bytes are used in the IV. The encryption key is &#8216;generated&#8217; using a PBKDF2-like function that uses MD5 hashing, but unfortunately when storing data in the registry they aren&#8217;t using a password - so the outcome is based purely on an MD5 hash that they are using as a &#8216;seed&#8217; value. This means that the key used is always the same.</p>

<p>Better: the key is only 56 bits.</p>

<h3>AES-56</h3>

<p>On the AuthenTec&#8217;s website they mention using 56-bit AES (due to the old export restrictions) - this confused me for quite some time, not only does AES not support 56-bit (or anything else less than 128 bits), from looking at the algorithm trying to make it support a key size that isn&#8217;t a multiple of 32 bits would be quite challenging. So how did they do it? They cheated.</p>

<p>They are actually using AES-256, and padding both the 56-bit key and IV with nulls. In other words, they are taking a very strong crypto and stripping it of its value.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>Besides the Windows password, the data also includes the domain and login (all in Unicode), along with other various bits that&#8217;s less interesting from a pen-testing perspective. Looking at the raw data, you can identify the password from the <code>P1</code> header, <code>0x11</code> denotes the login, and <code>0x12</code> indicates the domain.</p>

<p>The biometric data may be of some interest, but not to me.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/brandonlw/upek-ps-pass-decrypt">posted</a> a proof-of-concept tool to Github, it&#8217;s written in C#, and thus requires the .NET 4.0 framework be installed (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/FingerprintEncryption.2012.10.16.1847.zip">download here</a>). I also plan to write a Metasploit post module, but it&#8217;s not ready yet.</p>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>So it turns out that AuthenTec <a href="http://support.authentec.com/Downloads/Windows/ProtectorSuite.aspx">released</a> a patch for this on 9/18 - and we missed it (as did pretty much everybody else). We were alerted to the patch late on 10/10, and last night (10/11), we completed work on breaking it. We&#8217;ve updated the Github repository with the new code, it supports both the old versions and the new version they released on 9/18. They are now using DPAPI (among other things), so if you have the new version, you&#8217;ll need to run it in the context of LocalSystem so that you can access the correct encryption keys. This can be done quite easily with <code>psexec</code> - see the <a href="https://github.com/brandonlw/upek-ps-pass-decrypt#readme">README</a> for details.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, the new version is somewhat more secure - but obviously, still easily attacked. They are now using a &#8216;seed&#8217; of 16 random bytes (which is stored in <code>ExData</code> and protected via DPAPI), which is then hashed with SHA1, the hash is then passed into their key derivation method to produce the 56 bit key that is used to encrypt the main data block. Within the main data block there is another DPAPI block where the password was previously stored - this was something of a surprise to us at first, as they had obfuscated the code to hide this part. This second DPAPI block contains the user&#8217;s password, and can be easily decrypted with the same method used to decrypt the block containing the &#8216;seed&#8217; data.</p>

<p>Both of the DPAPI calls use the same entropy data - a block of 0x86 bytes, at the beginning is the word &#8216;Software&#8217; and a 0x01 at offset 0x2B and a 0x05 at 0x43 - and as said above, the DPAPI calls are made in the context of the LocalSystem user, and thus needs to be decrypted within that same context.</p>

<p>The new <code>homepass.dll</code> file contains new anti-debugging code, as well as obfuscated code to complicate reverse engineering - fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your point of view - these new &#8216;protection&#8217; mechanisms are trivial to bypass. To avoid this becoming a cat &amp; mouse game, we won&#8217;t be releasing further updates to this code - but I think it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s fundamentally broken, and any fixes they release can be bypassed without excessive effort.</p>

<p>I would not trust this software in a corporate environment.</p>
