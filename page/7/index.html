  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is the measure of a man; what makes one great, and another lesser? What separates success from failure? We all recognize light from dark, but at which point does it go from one to another? If we ask if a person (or company, or product) is successful - do we measure them against their closest competitor, their nearest neighbor, or perhaps the most successful person we know? Where, and how, do you set that bar to measure against?</p>

<p>Yesterday I talked to <a href="http://nadim.cc/">Nadim Kobeissi</a> for about an hour about Cryptocat, its policies, practices, successes, failures, and goals. The topic of goals led to an interesting discussion - to what standard is Cryptocat being held? Perhaps, just perhaps - the unforgivable security failures of Cryptocat are only so unforgivable because of the bar it&#8217;s being measured against.</p>

<blockquote><p>[this] is a crucible; in it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product: the truth, for all time.</p></blockquote>


<p>So, what it the true goal? Here is a snippet of their <a href="https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>, which (kinda) lays out the goal:</p>

<pre><code>Cryptocat is an experimental browser-based chat client for easy to use, encrypted conversations. 
It aims to make encrypted, private chat easy to use and accessible. We want to break down the 
barrier that prevents the general public from having an accessible privacy alternative that 
they already know how to use. Cryptocat is currently available for Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
</code></pre>

<p>The second sentence is the one that I find interesting, in light of the conversation I had yesterday; primarily this part: <em>an accessible privacy alternative that they already know how to use</em>. I asked Nadim at one point what his goal was, he responded without hesitation: to provide a safer alternative to Facebook Chat, Google Talk, etc..</p>

<p>When I asked about Cryptocat&#8217;s reputation as a tool for activists, he was clearly agitated and made his position on the matter very clear. That isn&#8217;t the intention, and he acknowledged that it&#8217;s not safe for that use. He then pointed me to a <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-a-follow-up/">quote on their blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have realized that due to some (perhaps well-meaning) media coverage of the Cryptocat Project, our work has been labeled by the media as something that can aid activists in overthrowing governments or help save someoneâ€™s life. This is not what Cryptocat is, it is wrong for the media to say that, and we have never said anything to that effect ourselves.</p></blockquote>


<p>Though I will note, the initial feeling seemed to be a bit different:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Cryptocat featured in Wired! <a href="http://t.co/Aj45zedr">http://t.co/Aj45zedr</a></p>&mdash; Cryptocat (@cryptocatapp) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocatapp/statuses/228921660324061184">July 27, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>So, where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">most recent flaw</a> was bad, very, very bad. <em>If</em> you understand encryption, the protection afforded was far less than expected. Let&#8217;s look at it from another perspective though: Compared to Facebook Chat. While the bug was bad, how does it compare to other consumer chat systems, even with that flaw in mind? From what I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s still a better option than Facebook.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s ignore encryption and just look at what we get from SSL/TLS:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=facebook.com&amp;s=173.252.110.27">Facebook</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/Qualys_SSL_Labs_-_Projects___SSL_Server_Test___facebook.com.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=crypto.cat">Cryptocat</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/Qualys_SSL_Labs_-_Projects___SSL_Server_Test___crypto.cat.png"></p>

<p>First thing that I can point out is the use of <a href="https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy">forward secrecy</a> - something Facebook isn&#8217;t using (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57591179-38/data-meet-spies-the-unfinished-state-of-web-crypto/">yet</a>). So, if you just look at SSL/TLS, Cryptocat is better - assuming nobody else has access to the ciphertext, which <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-our-first-full-audit/">happened</a> (at least) when they used Cloudflare.</p>

<p>How about data retention? While in the past Facebook has said messages are <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9896860-36.html">cleared after 90 days</a>, it&#8217;s not clear how long they retain the information today, or how much could be produced under subpoena - it&#8217;s clearly more than what <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/05/responding-to-law-enforcement-requests/">Cryptocat can</a> produce (as Facebook <a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/Facebook2010.pdf">produces a lot</a>). Just looking at what Facebook can provide, versus what Cryptocat can says a lot from a privacy perspective.</p>

<p>I could go through more details, or compare it in more detail to other services, but the basic point should remain.</p>

<p>From that perspective, I think Cryptocat has accomplished something - it may not be ideal, and has clearly been far from it; it&#8217;s still a better choice for casual communication than most (all?) of the major IM/chat players.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;I thought you said don&#8217;t use it?&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>In an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/07/bad-kitty-rooky-mistake-in-cryptocat-chat-app-makes-cracking-a-snap/">article</a> I was quoted as saying something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>He went on to recommend people not rely on Cryptocat to keep their conversations private until the code and the cryptography in it are thoroughly audited by professional penetration testers and cryptographers.</p></blockquote>


<p>I stand by that statement. If you <em>need</em> security, Cryptocat isn&#8217;t what you should be using, period. If you <em>want</em> privacy, it&#8217;s not a bad option. In a discussion on Twitter, the agreement was that there are no real competitors that provide secure multi-party chat - for those that want that feature, Cryptocat seems to be the only option.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out though, if you&#8217;re reading this, you probably know how to use PGP - and can use that to get around Cryptocat&#8217;s use-case. I&#8217;m not an apologist, and I&#8217;m not trying to excuse serious mistakes - I&#8217;m trying to present the issue, and the system itself in a fair light for the intended use-case, as Nadim explained it. In that light, the system still achieves its basic goal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everybody&#8217;s favorite whipping boy, <a href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a> is back in the news today - and it&#8217;s <em>bad</em>. Really bad. Steve Thomas has <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">found</a> a major flaw in the way Cryptocat generated ECC keys. Due to this flaw, the keyspace was only <code>2^54.15</code>, well below a secure level. Add a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack">meet in the middle</a> attack, and this is further reduced to <code>2^27.08</code> - which based on my rough estimates, is just slightly more secure than a paper bag.</p>

<p>The end result is of course, that anyone can crack the keys in a frighteningly short amount of time.</p>

<p>This flaw basically means that any group messages sent for nearly a year (a figure <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/">disputed</a> by the project) are wide open to attack. Personally, I would operate under the assumption that any message sent during that time has been read (or will be) - hopefully by somebody not interested in you. Probably hasn&#8217;t, but there&#8217;s no way to know.</p>

<p><strong>If you&#8217;re going to do one thing, do it right.</strong></p>

<p>Cryptocat has one mission, to provide secure communication - which is to say, to encrypt data. The most vital step in any crypto system is the key generation; if you get it wrong, nothing else matters. That code should be well reviewed and understood by multiple people. Cryptocat got this wrong.</p>

<p>Steve does a great job explaining the issue here; but the short version is that the person that wrote the code - and anyone that&#8217;s reviewed it since then, didn&#8217;t understand what they were doing. That simple.</p>

<p>When you release code like this to the public, and encourage people to use it - especially those that are at higher risk (i.e. activists), you take on a certain responsibility for ensuring that at least the core functionality is doing what&#8217;s expected. In this case, the team behind Cryptocat failed. For a year, the entire user base was at risk.</p>

<p>I recently mentioned Cryptocat in my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2013/06/19/opsec-the-nsa-and-you/">OPSEC</a> article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Last year was painful for Cryptocat - the last audit may have been clean, but who knows what else may be found.</p></blockquote>


<p>When I wrote that, I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be a bug that rendered the group chat encryption nearly pointless. While in <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/">their</a> blog post they seem to downplay the issue, I won&#8217;t - for a year, group chat was <em>completely broken</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto Is Hard</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that crypto is hard, everybody agrees on that. Or said more accurately, doing it right is hard.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Having spent the past month doing it, let me tell you: implementing cryptography is *hard*. Even for &#39;experts&#39;.</p>&mdash; Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/statuses/352815917924757505">July 4, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Writing key generation code scares me, I&#8217;m paranoid that I&#8217;ll get it wrong. So I take extra time to review it in detail. Then have other people review it in detail. I don&#8217;t release it to a &#8216;production&#8217; environment until I&#8217;m sure as I can be that it&#8217;s right. Can mistakes still make it in that way? Sure - but the odds are a lot lower.</p>

<p>This kind of code needs to be reviewed by those competent in crypto systems, and built to a specification that was designed by a real cryptographer. It can be expensive and time consuming, but that&#8217;s what it takes to keep the promises an application like Cryptocat makes.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>The problem: cryptographers aren&#39;t developers &amp; developers aren&#39;t cryptographers. The right solution is probably some Avengers-style mashup.</p>&mdash; Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/statuses/352816626170728450">July 4, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p><strong>Just how bad could it be?</strong></p>

<p>Based on recent disclosures, we know that the NSA has decided to store encrypted communication for later analysis, and I think it&#8217;s safe to say that other countries follow suit. So it&#8217;s likely there are stored Cryptocat communications floating around in various spy agency archives. These agencies may have already found this issue and used it to view messages, or now that it&#8217;s public - they can do so easily.</p>

<p>This is where an issue like this can be so devastating, if those encrypted messages have been saved anywhere - any users engaged in activity that their local government doesn&#8217;t care for are now at risk.</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t trust Cryptocat until it&#8217;s had a true code audit (the pen-test they had last year clearly doesn&#8217;t count), and the crypto systems reviewed by a true cryptographer. If a mistake like this was allowed in, and overlooked for so long, I&#8217;ve no doubt that other weaknesses exist.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been two weeks since news broke about the NSA <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">collecting massive amounts of data</a> from Verizon; and likely everybody else. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">PRISM</a> - whatever the hell that is - it seems there&#8217;s no agreement on that, and I doubt there will be anytime soon. What really matters here though, is we have proof that people are watching - and if it&#8217;s happening in the US, it&#8217;s probably happening everywhere else.</p>

<p>If you have any understanding of the intelligence community, all of this should come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever.</p>

<p>For me, it has served as a reminder of the importance of OPSEC in anything you&#8217;re doing. The NSA is collecting metadata, and lots of it - they repeatedly assure people that it&#8217;s harmless. And it is - if you&#8217;re a technophobic OPSEC master living in a cave. Where metadata is so valuable, is in cases where you are looking at people that leak little bits of personal data everywhere they go, then you use the metadata to connect the dots. Very soon, you have a great picture of what they are doing and who is involved - without needing access to voice recordings or other, more protected information.</p>

<p><strong>Knowing Where Your Weakness Is</strong></p>

<p>Many people are talking about tools and technologies now to defeat this kind of data collection - from Tor to Cryptocat, yet, there are issues; it sounds so simple, but it&#8217;s not. Tor for example, how easy would it be for someone with a large budget to put the network at risk? The approximate answer, is <a href="http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/10/good-luck-with-that/">easy</a>. How about Cryptocat or other encrypted communication tools? Last year was <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-our-first-full-audit/">painful</a> for Cryptocat - the last audit may have been clean, but who knows what else may be found.</p>

<p>Encryption is hard, and it&#8217;s very easy to write something that looks secure but falls apart when placed in the right hands - accidentally or otherwise.</p>

<p>The question is, is it effective against an actor with a massive budget? I would say it is, but not for the reason you might be thinking. Encryption is hard, both for those that implement and those that attack. But why spend the time and money on breaking encryption when you can take advantage of bad OPSEC to achieve the same goal?</p>

<p>People leak data constantly - how, when, and where they use their phone, who they email, how they use social networks - all of these things provide useful information for an attacker. Individually, they may seem to have no value, but it&#8217;s the connections they add to the overall picture that makes them so damaging.</p>

<p>Photo EXIF data, time of day trends in social media (or IRC), comments about the weather - all seem so innocent, but when combined can help to narrow down the list of candidates, and start building a picture of a person and their habits. Simple, innocuous, meaningless - until assembled.</p>

<p>No tool can fix this; using Tor doesn&#8217;t eliminate habits, encrypting email doesn&#8217;t hide social connections. Everything you do leaks data.</p>

<p><strong>Your Software Isn&#8217;t The Big Risk</strong></p>

<p>You are. Your friends are.</p>

<p>All the encryption software in the world won&#8217;t protect you from posting a picture with GPS data embedded in it; no 0day will put you at more risk than you are from your own mouth. No major actor needs to crack encryption, when they can collect massive amounts of metadata, and play connect the dots with the data you give them for free.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s even worse when you start talking to friends, what they know, they&#8217;ll leak. When you speak to anyone, assume that a link between you and them has been documented by somebody, somewhere - now that person is a target to see what little bits of data they leak about you. Or you are now a target because of them.</p>

<p>Trust no one, not even yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Know Your Enemy</strong></p>

<p>As Sun Tzu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">pointed out</a>, if you know your enemy - war is easy. The problem is, you don&#8217;t. Nobody knows just how much data groups like the NSA have - if you believe them, not even the NSA knows. Nor does anyone know what they are capable of collecting should the need arise. Large groups of <em>very</em> intelligent people with a secret budget and access to a secret court that grants almost everything they ask for - my guess is that they&#8217;re capable of a lot.</p>

<p>You know what tools are available - but how can you protect yourself, if you don&#8217;t know what works and what doesn&#8217;t? What networks are monitored? What agencies or companies are sharing data?</p>

<p>Having good tools is a start, but that must be part of a larger plan to control what you expose publicly. You must be very cautious about every bit of data that could be collected - no matter how insignificant it seems. Who you associate with and how needs to be carefully controlled to avoid both unwanted leaks and attention. Every action feeds data in a picture, how useful that picture is, is completely up to you.</p>

<p>Want to learn more, start with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU">grugq&#8217;s HITB OPSEC talk</a> if you&#8217;ve not seen it yet. If you&#8217;d like the short version, I&#8217;ll sum it up: STFU.</p>

<time datetime="2013-05-07T18:48:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 7<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the dark days of the web, if a service hashed your password instead of storing it in plain text, they were doing good. As sites were hacked, and credentials stolen, a silver bullet emerged: always hash <em>and</em> salt passwords when storing them. Many, many services were built with this design - <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/why-livingsocials-50-million-password-breach-is-graver-than-you-may-think/">LivingSocial</a> is a great example. SHA1 hashing with a 40 byte salt - once upon a time, that was considered reasonable protection. Today, you&#8217;ll be blasted by industry insiders and the media for that.</p>

<p>We all so often rush to criticize companies for not being on the cutting edge of security - but how often do any of us look at why? Do we ever ask who&#8217;s really at fault? Is the company at fault for not putting the money into updating systems, is it the engineers and architects for not knowing what they should do, or could it be something else - could the advice companies receive be part of the problem?</p>

<p>Looking at some recent breaches and the overall security position of the companies involved - it&#8217;s easy to see which companies get it and which don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s one recent example where I really believe the company and its staff were simply incompetent. From top to bottom, they showed little thought for security, privacy, or user trust (for obvious reasons, I&#8217;m not naming names). LivingSocial and some others - I&#8217;m less sure about, when those systems were designed they were likely following &#8220;best practices&#8221; - or at least what developers thought were best practices.</p>

<p>For a number of years many developers saw SHA1 + a strong salt as a silver bullet. They implemented and stopped thinking.</p>

<p>The problem is, attackers are advancing far faster than companies can adapt, and best practices that may be right for today will soon fail the &#8220;reasonable protection&#8221; test. Engineers and architects see a best practices document and build to that standard - if that document is even a couple years old, what they build is hopelessly dated and won&#8217;t provide the security the need.</p>

<p>Once that system is built - unless there&#8217;s a breach, what incentive is there to change it? At many companies it&#8217;s a constant fight to fund security related changes; when the change is to fix a system that&#8217;s only broken in the eyes of experts, and (to management) only matters if some other layer of security fails, you can expect a fight for that money.</p>

<p>Fixing things that aren&#8217;t obviously broken is hard. For those signing the checks, it&#8217;s not obvious that what was &#8220;best practice&#8221; a few years ago is today a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>There are many problems here, best practices are dated and inaccurate, there isn&#8217;t enough focus on secure storage, and there needs to be more push for better, more actionable recommendations that stand the test of time. While there are no silver bullets, surely as an industry we can do better than this.</p>

<p><strong>Secure Storage</strong></p>

<p>If I can get everything I need to start brute-forceing passwords from a simple SQL injection attack against your <code>users</code> table - your users are at risk. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your using SHA1 or <code>scrypt</code> - one day you&#8217;ll be breached, and passwords will be exposed. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

<p>The salt, the hash, or (probably better) both should be encrypted. It won&#8217;t help you in case your server is breached, but it&#8217;ll help if you&#8217;re hit with a SQL injection attack or other attacks that allow access to data, but not the system itself. As always, it&#8217;s not a silver bullet, but it adds protection in some situations, and anything you can do to make life harder for an attacker is a good thing.</p>

<p>This of course opens up the age old question of storing the encryption key, which I&#8217;ll leave as an exercise to the reader. This can be taken to the next level, encrypt the salt &amp; hash with an HSM - provides the best security, but that&#8217;s rarely an option because of expense.</p>

<p>There is some debate over this in the industry, but I&#8217;m a big fan of defense in depth - don&#8217;t make things easier for attackers.</p>

<p><strong>Useful Recommendations</strong></p>

<p>Crypto is hard, often confusing, and too often there is conflicting information. Implementing hash + salt is easy (and stupid), PBKDF2 is fairly simple - but you have to answer a couple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hash Function - SHA1-HMAC is a common option thanks to wide compatibility, though using a member of the SHA2 family would be far more appropriate.</li>
<li>Iteration Count - There&#8217;s no real consensus on this, some say it should double every two years (so this year it would be 96,000), others say it should be tuned to your server.</li>
</ul>


<p>Iteration count here is a real issue - if you blindly double every two years you risk server stability, on the other hand if you tune it to your server, you risk not keeping up with attackers. There&#8217;s no winning, no easy answer. When it comes to password brute-forcing, the advantage goes to the attacker - having faster hardware and more optimized software is common. It&#8217;s the job of the defender to constantly play catch-up.</p>

<p>With <code>scrypt</code> the options are even more complex, with too little obvious documentation to get developers going in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong></p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/pbhogan/scrypt">Ruby scrypt</a> implementation makes it quite easy to dynamically adjust cost settings - though if you run it on dated hardware, you run the risk of giving the attackers even more of an advantage. For those tied to PBKDF2 for some reason (i.e. compatibility), it would be easy enough to come up with dynamic adjustment code based on either performance benchmarking or date (following the somewhat risky double every two years approach).</p>

<p>Designing for dynamic adjustment gives defenders the best chance of staying current without costly upgrades. Again, not a silver bullet, but gives defenders a fighting chance of keeping up.</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve been looking for is a strongly opinionated library in the spirit of NaCl - secure by default, and hard to make insecure. For now, it&#8217;s clear that it should be based on <code>scrypt</code> - but ideally it could be easily updated in the future to use the winner of the <a href="https://password-hashing.net/">Password Hashing Competition</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on scrypt.</li>
<li>Easily updated to support new algorithms (with backwards compatibility).</li>
<li>Single cost setting, ideally based on approximate execution time.</li>
<li>Function output encrypted with AES256.</li>
<li>Reasonable minimum settings to prevent insecure usage.</li>
</ul>


<p>Something like that could be handed to a developer with minimal instruction, and allow them to provide reasonable protection today and in the (near) future. There are times when giving people what they want (options, control, etc.) does more harm than good - give developers just what they need, no more, no less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a (fairly quiet) critic of WikiLeaks for a long time, the core of the mission I agree with - information should be free, and should be preserved - but the implementation is deeply flawed. But then, that&#8217;s not really news is it? Two and half years ago when I last wrote about WikiLeaks, I pointed out that <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2010/12/01/wikileaks-biggest-problem-julian-assange/">Julian Assange was the organizations biggest problem</a>. So what do we have today? A grand idea perverted into a political machine, and twisted by ego and delusions of grandeur.</p>

<p>More than two years ago I wrote this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him as WikiLeaks.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today, I would say that perception is correct - WikiLeaks has become an embodiment of Assange&#8217;s personality. In the public&#8217;s perception, the man and the organization have become one; his role as the singular public face of WikiLeaks has clouded the publics vision and diminished the potential of the organization. While the reality maybe different, if the public sees Julian Assange as WikiLeaks - it&#8217;s fate is tied to his.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what we deserve - but it&#8217;s not what we need.</p>

<p><strong>The WikiLeaks We Need</strong></p>

<p>What we need is an organization with many vocal advocates, but no singular leader. What we need is information to be free, and openly accessible to all - a resource for legitimate journalists, unopinionated and apolitical. It should have a governance structure that allows simple leadership changes as needed. We need a resource for repressed information - either secret information from oppressive regimes or by overzealous laws such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/fifteen-years-dmca-abuse">DMCA</a>. There&#8217;s a wealth of information that is being lost while WikiLeaks focuses on political goals and public relations.</p>

<p>What we need is larger than any one person, and thus not tied to their faults or failings - what we need is a mission that&#8217;s bigger than the people involved, bigger than the organization.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it:</p>

<p><em>Governance:</em> The structure should allow members of a governance board to easily come and go; no member should be critical to continued operation. Should a member be unable to serve or potentially become compromised, it&#8217;s critical that their position be transferred with as little organizational impact as possible. All votes, actions, and minutes of the board should be published; the organization should be fully transparent. The governance board should be responsible for certain operational &amp; organizational decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Addition of new members to the board</li>
<li>Addition of &#8216;official&#8217; (i.e. trusted) mirrors</li>
<li>Approval of new content (or delegation to trusted persons)</li>
<li>Control of finances</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Technology:</em> Publishing should be distributed as possible, and use a lightweight front-end to minimize server load. A technology like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> could be used to make as many of the pages static as possible (for security, performance, and cost reduction). Once a site update is released, it should be made available to a set of official mirrors to handle spikes in traffic and help mitigate the impact of a server going offline.</p>

<p><em>Content:</em> As much legitimate information as possible should be published, but care must be taken to avoid publishing false or misleading information, or information that is clearly politically motivated. If there&#8217;s a public perception of political or ideological motivation, then trust is put at risk. Content that is potentially controversial or has potential legal ramifications should be put before a quorum of the governance board to vote on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Content should cover all legitimate repressed information - from highly technical system details so often attacked via the DMCA&#8217;s anti-circumvention clause, to the emails and memos that built WikiLeaks&#8217; early reputation. A hyper-focus on any one topic or type of information causes other valuable information to be ignored, a mistake that must be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Finances:</em> Financial reports should be regularly released to disclose how all donations are used. When money is involved, so is suspicion and mistrust - spending should be extremely conservative and fully documented.</p>

<p><em>Public Relations:</em> While there should be many vocal advocates for both the organization and the mission, there should be no single person that is entrusted with control. The focus should be on the goal - the freedom and preservation of information - not the individuals involved, or even the organization itself; the organization is just to tool, a means to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Will it happen?</strong></p>

<p>What I propose is an organization without ego, without politics, with adherence to a single mission and complete disregard for all other influences. In other words, what I propose is nearly impossible. There are few that believe so strongly in the ideals of freedom and preservation of information that they could be selfless enough to serve on the board of such an organization without letting personal opinions and motivations get in the way.</p>

<p>What I propose would be a haven for whistle-blowers and and those seeking freedom of speech - and no less of a target than WikiLeaks, and perhaps moreso due to expanding the focus to all legitimate information, not just the sole topic that WikiLeaks has adopted in the last couple years.</p>

<p><strong>Someday, maybe&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>We live in a time where information is produced at a nearly incomprehensible rate, and yet far too much of it repressed - by bad laws and worse governments. Without those working tirelessly to make it freely available, it would remain unseen by most, and possibly lost forever. Work always needs to be done, and WikiLeaks as we now know it isn&#8217;t the answer.</p>
