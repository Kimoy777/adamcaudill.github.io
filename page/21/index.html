<p>Though the tools needed for development seem to be public, I&#8217;ve yet to see the end-user run-time; though I imagine we&#8217;ll see that in the release anticipated for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Time to have some fun. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After several months of tests and experiments, I have finally determined something: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_photography">Infrared</a> with the Lumix <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0701/07013106panasonicfz8.asp">DMC-FZ8</a> just doesn&#8217;t work.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/2789422097"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/2789422097"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3184/2789422097_5bdc2f0d88_m.jpg" alt="Early IR Test" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to use a <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/stories/71">R72</a> Near-Infrared filter to filter out the &#8220;normal&#8221; light that we see, leaving only the infrared light that I wanted to capture. The FZ8 is sensitive to infrared, as can be easily demonstrated by taking a picture of a TV remote control. What you&#8217;ll see is a couple points of light coming from the remote; these are the infrared lights that are used to transmit commands to the TV.</p>

<p>Though having a camera that is sensitive to infrared, doesn&#8217;t make it suited for infrared photography. While the FZ8 is a great camera, being light weight, offering pro-level options (such as RAW mode) without the bulk of a DSLR - this is one thing that just doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the issues I&#8217;ve seen, and so far been unable to get passed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Auto-Focus: While this isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, auto-focus doesn&#8217;t work when the R72 filter is in place.</p></li>
<li><p>Manual-Focus: The FZ8 does offer manual focus, though using it when there is so little light making it to the sensor is nearly impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Grainy: Even when ISO is set to 100 instead of the default of auto, the images are extremely grainy. While this can provide a somewhat artistic effect - it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m looking for.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While it does seem to have some promise in replicating an infrared version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera">pinhole photography</a>, it simply doesn&#8217;t work for traditional infrared.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on a project recently that uses avatars, while planning out this specific feature it occurred to me - why should we re-invent the wheel? There&#8217;s already at least one service that specializes in doing it right: <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>.</p>

<p>While building something as simple as avatar support takes a relatively small amount of time, when working against a tight deadline or a tight budget every minute counts. In the world of an ISV (especially a young one) the balance of user satisfaction and development time is critical. Using a service such as Gravatar is a great way to give the users what they want with minimal impact to the timeline.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement">super-simple implementation</a> we were able to get it running within a few minutes - compare that to at least a few hours to build a custom system. Plus, reduced server load as we aren&#8217;t hosting the images and a cleaner, simpler interface as it&#8217;s one less option the user has to look through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the next few weeks (and months) I&#8217;ll be posting a series of articles on the tools and services that start-ups can use to make their business both more efficient and more profitable. This is aimed at ISVs (both micro and close to micro) though most of this should apply to any technology startup.</p>

<p>When you are starting a business, there are many important considerations with anything you use, here are the keys points I&#8217;ll be looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expense - This is probably the top requirement. Budgets tend to be quite limited, and there are always too many demands on what budget is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Effectiveness - It has to work; when running an ISV you simply don&#8217;t have time to waste. There is software to build and a business to run - there&#8217;s no time to waste on things that don&#8217;t work.</p></li>
<li><p>Power - Just because you&#8217;re running a small business, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to miss out on the power and features available to significantly larger business.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility - ISVs have a great benefit over larger businesses; agility. The very nature of smaller businesses give them a great ability to adapt to change - and the tools and services they use should be just as flexible.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are many great resources out there - the challenge is digging through the clutter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> for quite some time, though as time goes on and updates don&#8217;t come out, it seems less and less attractive. As most web-based services have fully embraced Web 2.o with all its AJAXy goodness, Tasks remains firmly entrenched in Web 1.0; and I&#8217;ve finally given up.</p>

<p>We are in a world where instant is no longer a nice-to-have, but an absolute must. Applications and services should; no, must provide immediate feedback and minimize full page loads whenever possible. Tasks has failed on this front.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>, a simple yet highly customizable task management system. While some things are rather different from Tasks (such as having multiple task lists, and not having nested tasks) for the most part it does everything that Tasks does - only it&#8217;s free (or $25/year for a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/upgrade/">Pro account</a>). With a low price, simple easy to use interface, and plenty of AJAX to keep things moving - it&#8217;s a real winner.</p>

<p>When I started using RTM the biggest issue I had was the lack of nested tasks that I had become so accustomed to in Tasks. The more I use RTM though, I&#8217;m finding that not burying tasks inside of other tasks is actually helping me to get more done, as less is being lost and forgotten about. While seeing all of the tasks laid out in front of me does seem a bit overwhelming at times, I am getting more done.</p>

<p>Overall, RTM helps me get thing done, while wasting as little time as possible managing tasks. Highly recommended.</p>
