  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow! It&#8217;s been over a year since this blog o&#8217; mine has seen any activity, though I&#8217;ve certainly not forgot about it. A lot has happened in the last year, so I&#8217;ll use this post as a bit of an update (and a warm-up for my return to blogging).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to promise you&#8217;ll see a new post daily as was once the case, though I&#8217;ll try to ensure something new is up at least once a week.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/cx7_ext1.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/cx7_ext1-150x150.jpg" alt="Mazda CX-7" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Life</strong> - It&#8217;s been an exciting year; I&#8217;ve moved into a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157603919212651/">new house</a>, now engaged (the big day is in May), and I&#8217;m now driving a <a href="http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&amp;vehicleCode=CX7">Mazda CX-7</a>. There&#8217;s a lot more, but I&#8217;ll not bore you with too many details.</p>

<p>The house is a restored 1880&#8217;s farmhouse that has some great history. Buying a house is an adventure, especially in this market. Scary might be a better word. The only real problem, is much like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1332-rural-internet-stuck-in-the-slow-zone">Jeff&#8217;s</a> (of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> fame), it&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere. My solution for the Internet issue was to sign up for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet">Satellite Internet</a>; it&#8217;s laggy but it works.</p>

<p>The new ride replaced my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157600242021713/">&#8216;07 Jetta</a> (which was a great car), the CX-7 has lots of power (244 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower">HP</a>), full-time all-wheel drive, and a very sporty feel. It&#8217;s a great car, and for a mid-size SUV it does pretty well on fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting</strong> - When I last posted I had been with <a href="http://radicalv.com/">RadicalV</a> for a few weeks shy of four years. When I left they were pretty much falling apart - downtime was common, no support at all, and numerous other issues. Once I moved to the next host, it took them three months to cancel the account and stop billing me. It started out as the best host I&#8217;d ever used, and ended as the worst. My understanding is that the company was sold since then, so hopefully things have improved for their remaining customers.</p>

<p>After leaving RadicalV, I went a fairly new (at the time) host, <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">HostingRails</a>. I was mostly happy with them; great service, reasonable prices, and the very latest of everything. The major downside though was the server loads. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for the load to be so high that it was grinding to a halt. Great service but it seems they are pretty over-sold.</p>

<p>And now? I&#8217;m currently on <a href="http://www.servage.net/">Servage</a> because of its clustered environment and low prices. As time goes on, I&#8217;ll post updates on how this one works out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910-150x150.jpg" alt="Dell Mini 9" /></a>Computers</strong> - My primary laptop has changed from my trusty Acer to the ultra mobile <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-9?cs=19&amp;s=dhs&amp;ref=homepg">Dell Mini 9</a>. At just over two pounds and up to four hours of battery life, it&#8217;s a carry anywhere on the go Â type system. It&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the cheapest of the so called netbooks, but with a little work it&#8217;s a great system. I&#8217;m running Windows 2008 Server with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vijaysk/archive/2008/02/11/using-windows-server-2008-as-a-super-desktop-os.aspx">Desktop Experience Pack</a>. When configured correctly, it&#8217;s a killer system.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong> - I&#8217;m still at the same company, though my responsibilities have changed. I&#8217;ve crossed the line into management. I&#8217;ve often heard the joke that managing developers is more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Herding-Cats-Primer-Programmers-Lead/dp/1590590171">herding cats</a> - it&#8217;s quite true.</p>

<p><strong>This Site</strong> - I&#8217;ve upgraded the site to the latest beta release of WordPress, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/11/wordpress-27-beta-3/">2.7 Beta 3</a>. What does this mean for you? Not too much, it did allow me to add a &#8217;<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/tags/">Tags</a>&#8217; page, but most of the changes are behind the scenes. If you have a blog, I <em>highly</em> recommend you upgrade. I upgraded from 2.2 and it was quite painless.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting on management styles and tools and tricks soon.</p>

<p>So, there we go - I think we&#8217;re all caught up now. :)</p>

<time datetime="2007-10-09T01:15:44-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 9<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/02/06/from-outlook-to-gmail-to-the-bat/">again</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to switch email clients; this time from <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/">The Bat</a> to Gmail, or more specifically, to <a href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a>. After some recent issues with The Bat (mostly relating to a recent update), I decided to make another go at switching to Gmail; but this time trying the Google Apps version.</p>

<p>After my last attempt, I was <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/02/06/from-outlook-to-gmail-to-the-bat/#comment-387">informed</a> that the Google Apps edition of Gmail doesn&#8217;t suffer the <code>Sender</code> issue that so plagued me before. After almost a full day of work, the transition is complete. And I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>

<p>The only downside is the expense - all in all, it cost $78.95 to go through this process. This was spent on two tools that made the process possible:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.aid4mail.com/">Aid4Mail</a> - A key application used for converting the various mail-storage file formats.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.limitnone.com/products.php?p=gmove">gMOVE</a> - Used for importing PST files into Gmail.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The process itself was simple, once I had found the software I needed, which took some doing. Here&#8217;s an overview, and some notes if you happen to try something like this (this assumes that you have Outlook installed).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Export messages to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mailbox</a> format. (If you are moving from Thunderbird this isn&#8217;t necessary as it already is stored in that format.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use Aid4Mail to convert the mbox files to PSTs</p></li>
<li><p>Load PSTs into Outlook and cleanup as necessary (remove duplicates, cleanup directory structure)</p></li>
<li><p>Launch gMOVE and use it to import the messages from Outlook to Gmail</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a couple major differences in this attempt, compared to the last. A few things annoyed me about the way things worked after the last time, not the least of which is that by using <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/">Gmail Loader</a> you loose all meaningful timestamps. So you don&#8217;t know when a message was sent or received.</p>

<p>gMOVE eliminated that problem. It sends the messages to a special POP3 server, and automatically configures your Gmail account to use it. That way, they can control the timestamps, and set them to what they originally were 1.</p>

<p>So after all is said and done; I think I&#8217;m happy with this system; much better than last time. I simply can&#8217;t justify using a desktop based email client anymore. It just leaves you too out of touch.</p>

<blockquote><p>1). There is a security issue here, so I wouldn&#8217;t do this with anything containing sensitive information.</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2007-08-27T22:55:35-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 27<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently heard about <a href="http://jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a> (hat tip: <a href="http://boren.nu/archives/2007/07/03/recent-geekage/">Ryan</a>), and decided that might be the backup solution I&#8217;ve been looking for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got thousands of pictures, hundreds of megabytes of source code, and documents dating back several years, all of which I&#8217;d like to ensure I never lose.  So far I&#8217;ve shied away from all of the online backup solutions due to the expense. But JungleDisk uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">Amazon&#8217;s S3</a> service for storage, complete with its rather inexpensive pricing model.</p>

<p>With that pricing model, JungleDisk has the potential to provide most of what I need, and some extras that are quite nice; all at a better price. So far, I&#8217;ve looked at two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use an online service. Much lower startup cost, but comes with a recurring fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a backup server. This will require at least 1TB of fully redundant storage. I&#8217;ll also have to identify software that will meet my needs. Much higher startup cost, but only minimal maintenance costs after that.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>JungleDisk has a few upsides, the biggest for me is that I can access it from anywhere that I can install the client, not just when I&#8217;m connected to my home network. With a low price, simple, but flexible interface, and a great storage system on the back end - it certainly sounds like a winner.</p>

<p>Though, there are some features I&#8217;d like to see, that it doesn&#8217;t offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Access to files without installing software.</p></li>
<li><p>Incremental backups. This would make backing up PST and similar files far more reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>Store multiple versions of a file.</p></li>
<li><p>Compress data before uploading. This would save a fair bit of bandwidth for me, as I backup things such as conversation and chat logs.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Will these missing features be enough to not use the service? I don&#8217;t know yet, I&#8217;ll give the service a couple weeks to see how it goes. So far I&#8217;m fairly impressed, though wish it offered more features.</p>

<p>Once I hit the two week-mark, I&#8217;ll post a status update; and my final decision as to whether I&#8217;ll continue to use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it was a while back that I said I would start writing again - that just never quite happened.</p>

<p>Much interesting has happened in these months, a few co-workers left the company, a few new faces came in; there was also a promotion and a number of new projects. Oh, and there&#8217;s a new relationship, and a fair bit of time now going to my old profession and now hobby of photography. Between all of these, spare time isn&#8217;t something I have much of - if any.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, many people would give up and walk away - but I see this as being important enough to fight for. It&#8217;s a matter of priorities and time management. For a developer, being active in the community is important; it&#8217;s easy to be left behind once you find yourself outside the loop. So, I&#8217;ll simply have to make community involvement a higher priority than it&#8217;s been. As for time management though, the story isn&#8217;t so simple.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> (which I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/01/21/task-management-with-tasks/">highly recommend</a>) for a while now to keep track of what I&#8217;m working on, and for that it is quite effective. For time management though, I need to reevaluate how I work completely; find a method that allows me to be as productive as possible. I&#8217;ve seen a number of articles, guides, and books on the topic, so I believe I&#8217;ve a fair bit of reading in front of me. As I go through this process, I&#8217;ll write about my findings, and share any solutions I find.</p>

<p>If anybody has advice on how to make time for everything, I would certainly like to hear it. Hopefully, this time when I say this blog is coming back to life, it actually will.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Later this week I&#8217;ll start the process of closing my start-up, aDeVIX Software. After months of planning and development, the decision has finally been made to call it a day. It was a great idea, but time and money conspired against us, with great effect.</p>

<p>We had a great product in mind, just not the resources to make it happen. I do believe that it would have been quite a success, but it takes a fair bit of time, and even more money to launch a commercial product aimed at mid-size businesses. It&#8217;s not a simple thing to sell software costing more than $10,000 per install; and being a company with no reputation, it&#8217;s almost impossible.</p>

<p>We planned the design, the marketing, the budget (even allowing for snacks &amp; drinks), covered every detail, but when you don&#8217;t have the time to write code, or the money to pay people to write it for you; no amount of planning will help. We then delayed, then came up with smaller, simpler products, then scrapped all that and went back to the original idea.</p>

<p>Months of work, thousands of dollars in various expenses, and not a single dime as income; much effort, no reward. Many thousand lines of code, a few websites, countless meetings, and enough notes to account for the clearing of a small forest; but no money, no assets of value, nothing. It&#8217;s a bit painful to think about all the effort, and see that it was all for not.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly possible to make an ISV work, it&#8217;s just a matter of being honest with yourself. Can you afford the expenses? Do you have the time? Will you be able to support the product yourself until it brings in enough money to hire people?</p>

<p>In some ways though, I&#8217;m happy that this is done, as it now leaves me free of any potential conflict of interest when it comes to pursuing future opportunities.</p>
