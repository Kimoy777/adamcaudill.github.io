  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a project coming up that will require some iOS development – which means that it has to be done on a Mac. Seeing as I didn&#8217;t own a Mac, and as the more I spent on acquiring one, the less money from this project will end up in my pocket; I needed a cheap solution. In the end I acquired a very nice 13&#8221; MacBook from CowBoom.com; so this is both about the deals that are available and a review of my experience with the seller.</p>

<p>The Options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Retail: It is well-known that Apple rarely allows discounts; and when they do permit them, they are typically small. It&#8217;s possible to save a few dollars by buying through Amazon (i.e. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC516LL-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002C7489S/">here</a>) or the like, but the savings is likely to be in the 5% range.</p></li>
<li><p>Hackintosh: For those not familiar, a hackintosh is a PC running a modified version of OS X to bypass hardware restrictions. Lifehacker has a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5672051/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-mac-and-install-os-x-in-eight-easy-steps">hackintosh guide</a>that details all of the steps and hardware necessary to get it all working. Per the Lifehacker guide, it&#8217;s a little over $900 once you figure in sales tax (if you&#8217;re unlucky enough to live in TN as I do); by switching out a few parts (case, power supply, HDD), the price with taxes drops to a little over $800. This though, has a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Legality: Doing this violates the OS X license agreement, which is kinda significant.</p></li>
<li><p>Support: There is none, period. Your best bet is posting to forums and hoping that others have seen the issue before.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency: Seeing as these boxes run a modified kernel, it&#8217;s possible that these modifications could lead to inconsistent behavior between them and a real Mac; when you are writing software, this could be a big deal.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates: Apple has already intentionally <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/10/31/hackintosh-netbook-users-take-note-snow-leopard-10-6-2-update-kills-support-for-atom-processor/">broken</a>support for Intel Atom processors to combat Hackintosh Netbooks which were becoming quite popular. You never know what they&#8217;ll try to break in future updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware: Seeing this isn&#8217;t a supported configuration, hardware support is iffy at best. You have to carefully select what hardware will be used; ideally duplicating someone else&#8217;s tested and confirmed-working build.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>eBay: I spent the better part of a weekend looking through hundreds of listings; researching specs and features, comparing prices, and analyzing feedback. As is expected with eBay, there&#8217;s a bit of everything: items beat to death, broken, way overpriced, or great deals that get snapped up almost as soon as you see them. The only thing missing is any form of consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Craigslist/etc.: Quite similar to eBay, except with somewhat better prices and fewer choices.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After pouring way too many hours into the search, I ran across a post on slickdeals.net mentioning that CowBoom.com had a <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/product/715713">good deal</a> on them. I&#8217;d never heard of them, and thinking them to be something of a joke thanks to the terrible name (my odd hatred of cows notwithstanding), but given the lack of progress – off I went to do some research. It turns out ta CowBoom was <a href="http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y10/m04/i12/s01">developed</a> by Dealtree, which BestBuy acquired in 2008; if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that there are backed by a major player, I would have just went on and ignored them.</p>

<p>Dealtree is effectively the liquidation arm of BestBuy, responsible for converting returns, damaged items, and the like into cash via different outlets; the better items go to CowBoom to be sold or auctioned.</p>

<p>When you buy something from CowBoom, you are presented with a list of individual units which includes a list of what&#8217;s included or missing, its condition, and any inspection notes. You can go through this list to pick the one that looks best, and that&#8217;s the one that will be shipped to you. It&#8217;s a fairly nice system, though prices should be carefully checked; I&#8217;ve seen items that were several years old going for more than the current version as well as items going for more than retail (though this seems to be a fairly rare case).</p>

<p>After looking at their prices and the unit description ($689 for the current MacBook [$750 after taxes]), and seeing the 30-day <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/rma/">return policy</a> – I decided that was the best route to go. So on the 19th I placed the order. Overall, I felt like I was getting a good deal and was rather happy.</p>

<p>This is where the warm-fuzzy starts to fade.</p>

<p>Despite ordering on the 19th, the package wasn&#8217;t actually shipped until the 27th. It finally arrived on the 3rd, 14 days after being ordered; it came from California though I often have better turn-around times with packages coming from China. Needless to say, the shipping was a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Knowing that it was likely a retail return certainly left me a bit wary, but being tested (or so they say) and covered by a no-questions-asked return policy made me more confident that in the end I would have a decent unit. It was packed quite securely, and I was quite relieved to discover that the laptop was in the original package; I pulled it out of the box and was surprised that it was in perfect condition, and that the power cord was still sealed with the original packaging. Jackpot. It would have cost me more than $1,100 after taxes to buy that same laptop from Apple.</p>

<p>The feeling of victory quickly faded though; I pressed the power button and nothing happened. No lights, no sound, nothing. After plugging it in, it booted up immediately; most laptops I&#8217;ve purchased were shipped at least partially changed so this seemed a bit odd to me. Being suspicious, I checked the battery information – it wasn&#8217;t charging and was only showing 1 charge cycle. Now I know why it was returned.</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable couple hours as I researched and tested different solutions; though after resetting the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964">SMC</a> multiple times and numerous reboots – it started working. I&#8217;ve been using it pretty heavily over the last couple days while configuring it for development, since getting through that fist issue there&#8217;s been no problems at all.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve got a new MacBook that&#8217;s in great condition with no issues for well under retail. Was the time and trouble worth it? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p><em>[Note: I apologize for the excessive length of this post; I originally intended to only write a few brief paragraphs, not a 1,100+ word essay. Perhaps now that I&#8217;m primarily writing code in C#, that tendency to verbosity that I learned from my Visual Basic days is expressing itself in my writing. After writing this I showed it to my wife and asked if it was too long; she quickly glanced to the bottom and asked where the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button was. Point made quite clearly. I will endeavor for brevity in the future for posts such as this. If you have made it this far, please give yourself a cookie for me, you deserve it.]</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WikiLeaks has a growing issue that could easily lead to its downfall, and that problem is its leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. As time goes on, he is becoming the persona of the organization, and as this happens he becomes more of a target, and more of a threat to the organization&#8217;s stability. There are rumors of death threats and assassination plots, on top on the fact that he is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange">wanted</a> in Sweden for what he has claimed to be trumped-up charges. Those that seek to stop WikiLeaks are increasingly attacking Assange directly, and focusing less on those behind the scenes or the organization itself. One outspoken leader doesn&#8217;t make the organization.</p>

<p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him <em>as</em> WikiLeaks. If he was arrested today, how much faith would there be in WikiLeaks? I am sure that they have developed contingency plans should something happen to Assange, but those plans will likely do little to promote faith and trust, or to calm the media firestorm that would surely erupt.</p>

<p>For WikiLeaks to survive the trials that it will soon face, they need to ensure that there is a strong governance body in place controlling the organization. For their mission to continue, they must become more than just Julian Assange to the public. Trust is <em>the</em> key asset for WikiLeaks, and if that trust is lost, then few will accept the authenticity of their releases; they must take steps to preserve that trust.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple weeks ago, Hulu Plus shed its beta tag and opened to the general public. When this happened, the price was changed and a new one week free trial was added. As a subscriber I was happy to hear about the new lower price, though my main concern was wondering if I would have to contact them to get the price break. That concern, thankfully, was the furthest thing from the truth. Soon as the news hit, I found this email waiting for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Adam,</p>

<p>Thanks for being a subscriber to Hulu Plus during our preview. We&#8217;ve been hard at work refining our existing applications, expanding the device coverage, and extending our content lineup. We&#8217;re excited to announce that today, Hulu Plus is officially launching out of preview to anyone in the U.S. for just $7.99/month.</p>

<p><strong>Since we&#8217;re now offering Hulu Plus at a lower price than during the preview, your subscription fee has been lowered to $7.99/month, and on your next billing cycle, we&#8217;ll also automatically credit your account with $2 for each month you&#8217;ve been a subscriber. In addition, we&#8217;re now offering a 1-week free trial for all new subscribers, so we&#8217;ll be issuing you an additional $2 credit since the free trial wasn&#8217;t in place during the preview.</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;d also like to offer you the chance to earn more free time on Hulu Plus by helping us spread the word about the service. For each friend who uses your referral to join Hulu Plus, we&#8217;ll give you two additional weeks for free, up to 20 weeks total. Each of your referrals will also receive two weeks free on their first month&#8217;s subscription. For more details on the program and to invite your friends, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals?src=plus_launch">http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Hulu Plus preview began, we&#8217;ve added more TV shows and extended our device coverage. To see which shows are now available on Hulu Plus, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#content">http://www.hulu.com/plus/content</a>, and to see the most up-to-date list of supported TVs, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes, mobile phones, and tablets visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#devices">http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting us during the Hulu Plus preview. We look forward to continuing to work on your behalf in the months and years to come.</p>

<p>The Hulu Team</p></blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added)</p>

<p>This is about the last thing I expected, especially from a company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu#History">backed</a> by major media players. I would hate to imaging how much this move cost them, but I know it bought them plenty of loyalty; it&#8217;s rare to to see companies go out of their way to be fair to customers, and even moreso when it means giving back money they&#8217;ve already collected. If you want to win the hearts of your customers, this is the kind of move that does it.</p>

<p>If you change the price on a service or application – how will you current customers feel? Will they feel cheated for being an early adopter? It&#8217;s your current customers that will bring in new customers; make sure you take good care of them, and they will take care of you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recent release of <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/">diplomatic cables</a> by WikiLeaks has caused many to stop and think - which is always a good thing in my opinion. Of the many comments I&#8217;ve seen on this subject, one by Jeff Atwood seems to be the most relevant:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;WikiLeaks is preaching a message I&#8217;ve always practiced: there should be no difference between internal and external communication&#8221; (<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/statuses/9505496079798272#">twitter</a>)</em></p>

<p>Be it for a personal vendetta, political reasons, or perhaps just the love of chaos; there is always somebody that would love to take your secrets &amp; thoughtless words and expose them to the world. Even with the best security systems that the US Government could build, one person that wanted it all exposed was able to leak hundreds of thousands of documents before <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8166395/Bradley-Manning-The-prime-suspect-of-giving-files-to-WikiLeaks.html">exposing himself</a> and ending his crusade.</p>

<p>We should all be taking at least some precautions to protect our private communications, ensuring we use SSL wherever possible, avoiding unencrypted wireless networks, encrypting sensitive data and the like. By making a few smart decisions our secrets are a little safer, but there’s always the risk that there will be an insider ready and waiting. Anytime there is <em>interesting </em>communication, there will be people who want to see it exposed.</p>

<p>In my current position, I tend to see a lot of dirty laundry go through my inbox – nothing illegal, but some things that could certainly be embarrassing. At times I’m amazed that people would type some of the things that they do, both our clients and internally. If they had been a little more careful about what they said, nobody would ever care; but as it stands, if publicly released they could lead to a real black-eye on somebody’s reputation.</p>

<p>To minimize exposure to these risks, words should be carefully chosen and the impact of public disclosure always considered.</p>

<p>Obviously though, there are times that the subject is sensitive and that is simply unavoidable. All one can do is take all the reasonable precautions and carefully consider the impact of their words, should they be exposed to the rest of the world.</p>

On Monday, August 2nd 2010 at 11:16 PM, Christopher Adam Caudill was born.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces and 19.25 inches, born just 24 minutes after our arrival at the hospital. He was born almost a month early, and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, in addition to having issues maintaining his body temperature (as is common with babies born early). Thankfully, the next day the pneumonia diagnosis was withdrawn and his body temperature stabilized.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, both mother and baby were discharged with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>(Sorry for not posting this sooner, decided it would be best to drop off the radar until things calmed down.)</p>
