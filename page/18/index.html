On Monday, August 2nd 2010 at 11:16 PM, Christopher Adam Caudill was born.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces and 19.25 inches, born just 24 minutes after our arrival at the hospital. He was born almost a month early, and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, in addition to having issues maintaining his body temperature (as is common with babies born early). Thankfully, the next day the pneumonia diagnosis was withdrawn and his body temperature stabilized.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, both mother and baby were discharged with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>(Sorry for not posting this sooner, decided it would be best to drop off the radar until things calmed down.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine my surprise when one of my developers mentions he has a virus and I see this on his screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010/07/IMG_20100726_163201.jpg.scaled1000-300x224.jpg" alt="" />
No, the items listed aren&#8217;t the issue, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Tool">Security Tool</a> that&#8217;s the virus. It&#8217;s vicious, plain and simple. It prevents almost all software from running (either by presenting a &#8220;virus warning&#8221; or simply killing the process), presents fake BSODs, and who knows what else that we didn&#8217;t notice. Only Explorer and Internet Explorer were operational, all other software was disabled.</p>

<p>As soon as the issue was found, the workstation was removed from the network while we attempted a clean-up via <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a> and a couple other similar tools. After running a scan from each tool in safe-mode it looked like we had it beat. We were wrong. The next reboot, and it was back - I&#8217;m not surprised but somewhat disappointed that none of the tools actually performed the cleanup correctly. There are several routes it could have taken to ensure that it would re-infect on boot, seems at least one of those was missed.</p>

<p>The one saving grace is that for some reason, it doesn&#8217;t attack while in safe-mode. Had this not been the case, data recovery would have been far more time consuming than it was (about four hours). Once the data was secured and logs and various backups for later analysis were captured, the workstation was re-imaged. In total, probably 30 hours were lost among development, technicians, and networking - not to mention the time spent by the security team members. A rather costly exercise, all things considered.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still one question floating around - how did this happen? The workstation in question was running a fully patched Windows XP install, Symantec Corporate anti-virus with the latest updates, behind a firewall and content filters, yet it still happened. How did our pricey anti-virus solution not detect this? Why didn&#8217;t it detect anything at all?</p>

<p>It amazes me that here in 2010 we still have to worry about computer viruses (or virii, if you prefer); but I find it utterly unacceptable that that a top-tier, fully managed and updated anti-virus product allows such a debilitating pile of code to execute. Computer science has made amazing strides and modern PC hardware has more than enough resources to perform more intense analysis and monitoring - yet it still happened.</p>

<p>Have we actually lost this battle?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Disclaimer: This is something of a rant, and was written at 3AM. My apologies if it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Feel free to ignore.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 3AM, and I&#8217;m up reading, again. Is it the latest great novel or one of the classics that I enjoy so much? No, it&#8217;s research for my latest hobby. It&#8217;s lasers this time, but this pattern is far from new.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think I just try to do too much, I go in too many different directions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve sunk literally thousands of dollars and countless hours in photography, invested more than I would dare guess in hardware and software in various software development projects. I&#8217;ve collected everything from coins to <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/bayonet-collection/">bayonets</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157594276549640/">swords too</a>). Now, all I&#8217;m thinking about is lasers; and I&#8217;m not talking about pointers, but the kind of lasers that light a match in an instant or burn a hole through cardboard and plastic.</p>

<p>Lasers at this power aren&#8217;t cheap, quite complex, and extremely dangerous (not to mention it&#8217;s a felony to import 99% of the ones on the market into the US). Sounds perfect for me, right?</p>

<p>In my typical fashion, to justify the expenses and time investment, I start looking for a return - I start working on a business plan. It&#8217;s starts with a basic idea, then a domain name or three, a quick(-ish) web page, and weeks of losing sleep to get everything ready. That start, is also normally the end. I get busy at work which leads to me thinking about other things and soon several weeks have gone by and I&#8217;m looking at a new, more exciting hobby or project. Some hobbies (mostly photography) come back, most others don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Wash, rinse, repeat - ad nauseam.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always educational - I always manage to get something new out of a hobby; but at what cost? Losing the money isn&#8217;t too big of a deal for me (though moreso in the last couple years than the past), but the wasted time is another story. Few people fully grasp how valuable and fleeting time is - especially with those you care about.</p>

<p>So here it is, time I should be resting up for all things I need to do to keep my life together, and I&#8217;m making a list of all the things I need to buy and think about for my laser projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Buying a Laser Power Meter</p></li>
<li><p>Buying a bunch of DVD/Blu-ray sleds to harvest the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode">laser diodes</a></p></li>
<li><p>Designing a custom power regulator (driver) using <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, because a simple non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">IC</a>, non-programmable setup is just too boring</p></li>
<li><p>Getting a rough model of my custom host designed in whatever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">CAD</a> software I have handy</p></li>
<li><p>Figuring out which lens I need for each color (and how bad of an idea it would be to a 650nm lens for a 405nm diode)</p></li>
<li><p>Ordering lenses, modules, and generic hosts (until the custom ones are ready) from China</p></li>
<li><p>Looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">PCB</a> manufactures that are willing to do small runs (and should I do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">SMT</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology">THT</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Reading through FDA and US Customs rules and polices (I really would hate to go to jail over a laser&#8230;)</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to get an attorney involved (as I really would hate to be sued&#8230;)</p></li>
<li><p>Or maybe I could just contract all this out to China and have them build what I want and legally import them (which leads to a rather scary list, trust me)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve learned more about safety regulations, customs operations, electronics, and manufacturing than I thought I would ever know.</p>

<p>The cost this time? I&#8217;ve got a huge project at work that is way behind schedule, which is bad. But there&#8217;s bigger things going on: within the next month my wife will be giving birth, and I&#8217;m just now realizing how unprepared I am for it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 3AM, and I&#8217;m lost in a world of lasers.</p>

<time datetime="2010-06-19T15:58:25-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 19<span>th</span>, 2010</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The company I work for is hiring several developers which marks my first significant hiring effort since being promoted to management. This had led to a few interesting observations* I would like to share that may benefit both those looking for a new job and those looking for the next star to add to their team.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration Law:</strong> I had no idea how complex this area of law gets; it&#8217;s a maddening maze of rules and policies that are more effective at confusing those involved than providing a reasonable solution to a problem. If you run into this (and you will), you need somebody that has dealt with this and knows what to do. Getting both parties into legal hot water is far too easy.</p>

<p><strong>Resumes:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen great resumes that made it clear that I needed to hire this person and resumes so cluttered and complex it took an hour just to get through it. Here&#8217;s a few things that stuck out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> is good for code, and for a resume. Clean and concise is always better; if you find yourself hitting Ctrl+C even once while working on a resume, you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Length is important, but shorter isn&#8217;t always better. Unlike many other fields where a single page resume is considered optimal, technical resumes need at least a second page. Going too short on a resume is a great way to blend into the crowd; a resume should stand out, and that takes space.</p></li>
<li><p>How long is too long? Unless you&#8217;ve been doing this for a <em>very</em> long time, more than three pages is probably excessive. This isn&#8217;t always true, but think it through before using more than two pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Use whitespace carefully. Don&#8217;t leave a page half empty or pack everything in so that it looks cluttered. As with any type of design, whitespace is a powerful tool that should be used wisely and never be left to chance.</p></li>
<li><p>Use color sparingly. Many corporate printers are black and white only, so if you use color make sure it looks right when printed without it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use bold even more sparingly. It&#8217;s sometimes useful to point out items of interest, but it quickly degrades the readability of a resume.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Many people seem to have a hard time with this, but a resume is a <em>textual representation of yourself</em>. It represents you as a person and your accomplishments as a professional. Any errors or signs of haste or carelessness say much about you as a person; if you are careless with such a significant representation of yourself what does it say about your attention to detail or work ethic?</p>

<p><strong>Experience:</strong> For a person that has recently graduated, experience in the field is the single largest hindrance both when it comes to securing a position and to receiving a salary they are happy with. The best advice I can find for people in this position is to look to the open source community for help. There are many projects that are desperate for developers and it&#8217;s a great way to get familiar with working in a team, coordinating with people over a distributed area, and releasing code for public consumption. In lieu of paid work experience, open source is a great way to fill in a resume (and it can be quite profitable for some, if you play your cards right).</p>

<p><strong>Salary:</strong> In some companies pay is a minor issue thanks to clearly structured systems such as that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000038.html">proposed</a> by Joel Spolsky; for others is can be a source of pain, envy, and jealousy. This is a topic that I truly hate; it&#8217;s uncomfortable at best and quite painful at worst. While I can&#8217;t offer much advice, here are a few things to think about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Money is not an effective motivator. In an ideal environment it should just stay out-of-the-way and allow developers to live a comfortable life; in reality the role it plays is a bit different. More often than not, it&#8217;s a distraction that gets in the way and outweighs the factors that do motivate people.</p></li>
<li><p>Companies follow a few different pay systems, and once set moving to different system is nearly impossible. Here are a few I&#8217;ve seen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clearly Structured: This system places developers on a scale, and developers at a given level receive the same salary (see <a href="http://fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Structured + Negotiated: This is the most common system I&#8217;ve seen; it mixes a structured level system with negotiated modifications that can apply a certain percentage increase from the normal base salary for that level or other benefits (extended vacation, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Negotiated: Pay is based on negotiation skills and need; this can lead to odd situations such as where a junior developer can make more than a senior developer due to the need to fill a position quickly. This system requires strict secrecy when it comes to salary information to avoid nasty surprises, unlike the clearly structured system where salary information can be openly shared.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Are large salary increases possible? Some companies have no issue with large increases in salary for a promotion (20%+) while in others exceeding 5% for any reason is a major challenge. If a developer is coming in on the low-end of the scale (i.e. due to lack of experience, such as a recent graduate), is there a real possibility of moving up? In my experience, people stay near the end they start at - those that start at the bottom will stay there until they move to a different company.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Interview Questions:</strong> If you are conducing an interview, make a list of questions and write them down. It&#8217;s quite embarrassing to suddenly realize that you are out of questions just a few minutes in (Need inspiration? Try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_interview">this</a> or <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">this</a>). Many people have said much about this, but the most important thing I can point out is just don&#8217;t wing it. Plan carefully, make sure you know what you&#8217;re going to do and when before the candidate shows up.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Dress Code:</strong> I&#8217;ve been amazed at what I&#8217;ve seen people wear, everything from high-end suits to jeans. What&#8217;s appropriate? It really depends on the environment; a large corporation will expect an Armani suit where a startup is happier seeing jeans and an American Apparel t-shirt. When in doubt, I would go with a suit personally - but depending on the company that could cost you the job just as quickly as showing up in jeans.</p>

<p><strong>Interviews Go Both Ways:</strong> An interview shouldn&#8217;t be a one-way affair; the candidate should be interviewing the company as much as you are interviewing them. They should be asking questions about the environment, expectations, tools and resources provided as much as you are asking them about prior experience and knowledge. If a candidate doesn&#8217;t seem to care about the company or what the working conditions are like - think carefully before hiring them.</p>

<p><strong>Other Thoughts:</strong> I&#8217;ll not go into what I look for when it comes to personality or other personal traits as that would require far more than a blog post to cover. I&#8217;m also going to avoid things such as hobbies and the like; while they can tell you much about a person they can also lead to other complications. Any question in an interview can quickly lead to a land-mine and in the legal quagmire that is HR law and policies, trouble is easy to find. When in doubt, just don&#8217;t ask.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is based on my experience over the years; not necessarily the experiences in this round of hiring or the opinions or policies of my employer. In general, nothing in this refers to policies, preferences, or procedures of my employer. <Standard Disclaimer /></li>

<time datetime="2010-06-18T23:42:05-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 18<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>While performing some testing on a Windows 7 Professional workstation running a VL build from MSDN I found that a feature I needed was missing - the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2009/07/01/using-multiple-monitors-in-remote-desktop-session.aspx">Multi-Monitor RDP</a> support. After a little <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Remote-Desktop-Connection-frequently-asked-questions#">research</a> I found that only the Ultimate and Enterprise editions support this feature; which thanks to Windows 7&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Anytime_Upgrade">Anytime Upgrade</a> feature I assumed this would be no issue.</p>

<p>But, it was an issue.</p>

<p>It turns out that the build of Windows 7 I was using was missing <code>WindowsAnytimeUpgradeUI.exe</code> and the other related files needed to make the Anytime Upgrade work - and copying the files from another box doesn&#8217;t work. It seems this build simply can&#8217;t be upgraded in this fashion. So I tried a few other tricks, hoping to find something that would work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reactivate Windows with an Ultimate key; fails with an error indicating that a Professional key is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Run Ultimate edition installer from Windows; fails with <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010-06-18_0332.png">this error</a> indicating that you can&#8217;t perform edition upgrades.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So being stubborn and determined not to re-install Windows to make this feature work, I started looking for other options. Thanks to a hack for <a href="http://www.gmtaz.com/how-to-upgrade-windows-7-rc-ultimate-to-rtm-enterprise/comment-page-1/">upgrading the RC builds to Final</a>, I found what I needed.</p>

<p>I edited the <code>EditionID</code> and <code>ProductName</code> to reflect Ultimate instead of Professional, rebooted, and then ran the Ultimate installer from within Windows. This time the installer ran without issue and after an hour and a couple reboots it was done. This in-place upgrade/repair procedure allows you to jump to a different edition with fairly little pain. A couple of Windows settings needed to be corrected (primarily display related) and Visual Studio 2010 had to be re-installed, though otherwise everything worked just as it did before.</p>

<p>This is the only method for upgrading these Windows 7 builds that I&#8217;ve found, the only other option is to re-install Windows from scratch.</p>
