  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a fairly active member of a forum focus on VB development, <a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/">XtremeVBTalk.com</a> (formerly VisualBasicForum.com), I also happen to be a moderator, and carry the &#8220;Expert&#8221; skill-badge. Well, today they gave me quite a surprise. Back 2003 I posted this on my site at the time:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong> 12/01/2003</strong>
<strong>Expert!</strong> The folks over at <a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/">VisualBasicForum.com</a> just voted to give me an Expert badge!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Today, a similar honor has been bestowed. By a vote of the forum leadership I&#8217;ve been given the status of &#8220;Guru&#8221; - the highest skill acknowledgment available. This was quite a surprise, and really quite an honor as this is a status given to only a select few. This makes me the 26th to receive this, of the 91,348 current members.</p>

<p>I really do appreciate this, to be judged so by a group that I hold in such high regard really does mean a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/04/09/rebuilding-my-network/">written</a> about, I&#8217;m in the process of rebuilding my network at home. the first major addition is a used <a href="http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/pe2500sc/en/ug/127kwc10.htm">Dell PowerEdge 2500</a> server, while this is an older server, it&#8217;s quite stable and reliable - and with I intend to use it for, being reliable is critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180001SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180001SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Front and box" /></a> <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180003SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180003SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Face behind the mask" /></a> <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180002SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180002SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Guts of the beast" />
</a></p>

<p>This server will have a couple different roles at once, here&#8217;s the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Domain Controller</p></li>
<li><p>Development SQL Server</p></li>
<li><p>Development IIS Server</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;Shared Files&#8217; share</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This will allow me to keep a stable system running for shared access to development resources, as well as centralize management for my various systems. This box may also see a few more tasks aimed its way in the next couple months as this project goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Server</strong></p>

<p>The process of rebuilding the server was surprisingly painless. After setting up the RAID array (set to RAID 10), there were no real speed bumps; the Windows install went smoothly and I was quickly on to setting up more important things, like my new domain.</p>

<p>I choose <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">Windows Server 2003 R2</a> as the OS due to its stability and flexibility. With the number of roles this system will have, along with the pounding development work will give it, those are very important traits. With the exception of a few issues while setting up the domain (like importing local accounts), the process was almost pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Server Details</strong></p>

<p>The server itself seems rather beef (keeping its age in mind), and more than enough I believe for what I have planned for it. For those interested, here are the vital details:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x <a href="http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sSpec=SL5U3&amp;ProcFam=25&amp;PkgType=ALL&amp;SysBusSpd=ALL&amp;CorSpd=ALL">933MHz Intel Pentium III</a> CPU</li>
<li><p>A second, matching CPU has already been ordered.</p>

<ul>
<li>6 x 18.9 GB 10,000 RPM SCSI Hard-drives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These are in a RAID 10 configuration giving about 50GB of fully redundant storage.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 x 300W redundant power supplies</p></li>
<li><p>1 x 128MB PC100 RAM dedicated to the RAID controller</p></li>
<li><p>2 x 256MB PC133 Registered ECC RAM</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This will be upgraded soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>While clearly this isn&#8217;t a power-house by modern standards, it is a very well made server, that packs plenty of power. I hope to keep this one around for quite some time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a daily basis, I use Query Analyzer for Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access for Sybase via ODBC, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/">MySQL Query Browser</a>  for a MySQL database, and <a href="http://www.allroundautomations.nl/plsqldev.html">PL/SQL Developer</a>  for Oracle access. While there are some features of all of these I really like, what I don&#8217;t like is that I have to use all of them.</p>

<p>I am proposing the formation of an open source project to develop a SQL front-end to allow users to access the major database platforms from a single, well-designed, and fully-featured front end. This would not be a full replacement of the afore mentioned applications, but a simpler, easy to use product wrapping the more common functionality. Developed in .NET (VB.NET most likely), this could greatly simplify the process of working with multiple DB platforms.</p>

<p>This is just an idea, and I would like to hear any feedback. If there&#8217;s enough interest, I may try to put something together to get the ball rolling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Piracy is bad, right? Maybe not, and it seems Microsoft <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-micropiracy9apr09,0,414067.story">figured</a> <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/04/13/windows-vista-pirates-wont-get-fancy-graphics/"> it</a> <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+Can+we+check+your+software+license/2100-1016_3-5371664.html?tag=nl"> out</a>. Piracy can be indirectly profitable, both by giving you additional customers that you may collect from at some future point, and it also serves to reduce or limit the market share of rivals. Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, acknowledged this back in 1998 while speaking at the University of Washington, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>_&#8221;Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people don&#8217;t pay for the software. Someday they will, though,&#8230;&#8221; _</p></blockquote>

<p>_&#8221;And as long as they&#8217;re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They&#8217;ll get sort of addicted, and then we&#8217;ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.&#8221; _</p>

<p>While Microsoft claimed losses of $14 billion for 2005, there were also several benefits as a result, that Microsoft rarely acknowledges. Among these is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limiting growth of rival products</p></li>
<li><p>Locking users into Microsoft products</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing overall market-share</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing brand awareness</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Given the choice, I&#8217;m sure that Microsoft would rather see the $14 billion they claimed they lost, though in reality, I don&#8217;t believe the number would be that high. There is an unknown variable in the equation, when determining what the loss due to piracy is; the number of users that would have chosen the same product if they had to pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>Holding Linux Back</strong></p>

<p>Even though at least one Linux vendor <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39195424,00.htm">sees possible value</a> in piracy, for the most part Linux stands to lose the most. It has been <a href="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=170700943">shown</a> that cracking down on piracy actually helps Linux. Users they are either not fully locked in, or adding new systems tend to be looking towards Linux, instead of sticking with Windows and its related products due to the high costs involved.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a vested interest in limiting the market share of Linux, and it other competitors, keeping this in mind, it easy to understand some recent moves Microsoft has made. One of the more interesting is the decision to block pirates from using the new Aero shell in Windows Vista (there is also <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/08-10WinXPStarterFS.mspx">Windows XP Starter Edition</a> which is interesting in its own right). This begs the question, if Microsoft thinks they can stop pirates, why let them run the OS at all?</p>

<p><strong>Locking Users In</strong></p>

<p>While hard numbers aren&#8217;t easy to find, there are <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld/article/03/08/29/34FElinux_1.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2153346/migration-costs-holding-back">reports</a> on the expense of migrating from Windows to Linux. Regardless of TCO, ROI, any business metric, it can be safely acknowledged that it isn&#8217;t cheap to move an entire corporate network to a different platform. This fact is a key benefit for Microsoft, as many businesses may find it cheaper to just pay, than to switch platforms.</p>

<p>As an example, take this fictional Asian company, running purely on pirated software, here is the vital information about their network:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>400 PCs running Windows XP</p></li>
<li><p>18 Servers running Windows 2003 Server</p></li>
<li><p>250 PCs with Office 2003</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive use of Excel automation in critical business processes</p></li>
<li><p>Most data stored in 2 SQL Server 2005 servers</p></li>
<li><p>All email stored in Exchange server</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a nightmare to convert, the user re-training, data migration, re-development of business processes. Facing a crackdown on piracy, this fictional business would have little choice but to pay up for what they are using.</p>

<p>If you can lock users into your products, and then latter try to put pressure on them to pay for what they are using, you have a far better chance of seeing money, than if the users had went with a different platform from the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Cashing In</strong></p>

<p>Through the use of programs like the afore mentioned restriction on the use of the Aero shell, and the use of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.mspx?displaylang=en">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> program to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6868504/">restrict the use of Windows Update</a>, Microsoft can apply additional pressure on the users of pirated versions of its software. While most anti-piracy schemes have been cracked fairly quickly, it does add significant pressure to the &#8216;casual pirate&#8217; - home or corporate users that simply got a copy from a friend.</p>

<p>By leveraging legal pressure and user annoyance, you can slowly begin to reap in profits from these users, if you can avoid pushing them to another platform in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m always interested in better ways to produce documentation or demonstrations for my software. One method I&#8217;ve found to be rather impressive is desktop capture, generating a movie either in a streaming format, or in Flash. The drawback: Price. The tools used for this are often rather expensive, and on a tight budget they can push you to the limit quickly. There is another option though, <a href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>  - a free, cross-platform application that generates Flash demos and presentations.</p>

<p>From my short review, this seems like an excellent option, and the fact that it&#8217;s free just makes it even better.</p>
