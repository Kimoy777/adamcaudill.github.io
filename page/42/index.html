  <div class="entry-content"><p>To celebrate 15 years of Visual Basic, a quick glance to the past:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Microsoft Announces Visual Basic at Windows World &#8216;91 General-Purpose, High-Productivity Programming System for Microsoft Windows</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>ATLANTA &#8211; May 20, 1991 &#8211; Microsoft today announced MicrosoftR Visual BasicTM programming system at the Windows World &#8216;91 industry trade show.  Visual Basic is a graphical application development system for Microsoft WindowsTM graphical environment version 3.0 that combines visual design tools with a powerful, general-purpose programming language and Windows .EXE compiler.  It provides a simple solution to the complex task of creating real Windows-based software applications.</em></p>

<p>_&#8221;We set out to create the fastest, easiest way to program for the Windows environment,&#8221; said Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and CEO.  &#8220;My goal from the start was to make developing Windows applications as easy and natural as possible.  We also wanted this tool to appeal to a broad spectrum of people interested in programming for Windows &#8211; from professional corporate programmers and consultants solving business problems to independent software vendors and casual programmers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system combines a rich, event-driven programming model with the world&#8217;s most widely used programming language in a tightly integrated package.  General development for the Windows environment is faster than ever.  The Visual Basic programming system provides visual user-interface design capabilities with powerful general-purpose programming tools, making it easy for any programmer to create compiled Windows .EXE files that can be freely distributed without run-time fees or royalties of any kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the most important software product of the year, if not the decade,&#8221; said Steve Gibson, president of Gibson Research Inc.  &#8220;It&#8217;s the ultimate intellectual tool. Thanks to Visual Basic, both casual and professional programmers can produce compelling and beautiful results. Now it&#8217;s easy to put together real Windows version 3.0 applications.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needed to create an application that incorporated Microsoft Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel,&#8221; said Craig Ellis, senior programmer analyst, Reuters Information Systems.  &#8220;Visual Basic was the tool to do this.  It filled our needs, allowed us to develop a fast and effective application and cut our development time by more than half.  It&#8217;s a fantastic product that allowed us to incorporate a family of Microsoft products into one application.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Visual Basic programming system can be used to develop any Windows-based application, including corporate business systems, tools and utilities, front ends to data (mainframe, server and local) or commercial Windows software products.  It is also useful for integrating multiple Windows-based applications and for automating software testing through dynamic data exchange (DDE).</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system provides visual design tools for creating the user interface components &#8211; windows and dialogs &#8211; of an application.  A full set of Windows interface components (including command buttons, text fields, list boxes, pictures, drop-down menus and file system controls) are created visually, without writing any code.  The forms engine for building the interface incorporates technology acquired from Cooper Software.  A powerful, structured programming language is then used to add functionality to these interface components, responding to events that are automatically trapped by the system.</p>

<p>The Visual Basic language is a derivative of the Microsoft QuickBasicTM modern programming system, modified for the graphical environment and the event-driven programming language.  It uses a threaded p-code incremental compiler and source-level debugging tools, including an interactive immediate window, in a tightly integrated system.</p>

<p>Extensibility</p>

<p>Support is provided for DDE, the mechanism for exchanging data with other Windows-based applications.  The Visual Basic system also supports dynamic link libraries (DLLs), which allow the user to establish links with other Windows systems facilities and call the Windows API or routines written in other languages and compiled into DLLs.  The control set itself can be extended by developers using C and the Windows SDK and the Microsoft Visual Basic Control Development Kit, available separately.  This extensibility will provide the ability to fully integrate new user interface components into the graphical design and code development environment.  Examples could include multimedia, pen controls and data access.</p>

<p>Printed documentation and online Help provide step-by-step instructions for writing programs.  The online Help system provides context-sensitive reference information and sample code that can be copied and pasted into a Visual Basic program.  An icon library of approximately 400 designs and an icon editor written in Visual Basic language are also included.  &#8220;The built-in help is excellent,&#8221; said Lee Perryman, deputy director of Associated Press Broadcast Services in Washington, D.C.  &#8220;The debugging features are superb, and the controls are rich and feature-packed.  Because there is almost no learning curve for users familiar with the Basic language, Visual Basic makes Windows programming a snap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system for Windows will be available in June 1991 for a suggested retail price* of $199.  German and French versions are expected to ship in August, with other foreign language versions to follow.</p>

<p>The Visual Basic programming system runs in either the standard or enhanced mode of Microsoft Windows graphical environment version 3.0 or higher.  The system requirements include a personal computer using 80286 processor or higher; hard disk; mouse; CGA, EGA, VGA, 8514, HerculesR or compatible display; MS-DOSR operating system version 3.1 or later and one or more megabyte of memory.</p>

<p>Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ &#8220;MSFT&#8221;) develops, markets and supports a wide range of software for business and professional use, including operating systems, network products, languages and applications as well as books, CD-ROM products and hardware for the microcomputer marketplace.</p>

<p>It was about 10 years ago that I decided to apply myself to learning Visual Basic, what an interesting journey it&#8217;s been.</p>

<p><a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> has <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/05/26/the-may-issue/">shipped</a> the second issue of their bundle o&#8217; schwag to approximately 1,500 subscribers, up from 50 for the first issue. The growth is amazing, and so is the money involved. This month they should have seen somewhere around $21,500 in gross revenue.</p>

<p>For a part-time project where you are just mailing out free stuff, $22,000 a month is not bad at all. There are of course a number of expenses, but this is what&#8217;s important: this is an innovative business model that really works. How well it would go in other industries, I don&#8217;t know, but after seeing the popularity of the Kings o&#8217; Schwag, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see similar attempts in other industries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using the &#8217;<a href="http://operawiki.info/WebDevToolbar">Web Developer Toolbar &amp; Menu for Opera</a>&#8217; for about the last month and after being reminded today about how useful it is, I thought I should probably mention it for those that haven&#8217;t heard about it.</p>

<p>This is an extremely useful set of toolbar modification to Opera to have a few very nice touches to it. For most of these tasks, there is a Firefox extension available, <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Web Developer</a>, which does the job quite nicely. Though switching back &amp; forth just to check something small can be quite a pain (as Opera is my primary browser), so thanks to this little gem, it save me that much more time.</p>

<p>As they say, time is money, so every bit saved is a good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>_&#8221;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.&#8221;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a> _</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a simple statement; yet one of such power. This statement carries a new impact as the concept of &#8221;<a href="http://www.procata.com/blog/archives/2006/03/01/extreme-simplicity/">Extreme Simplicity</a>&#8221; gains ground. The idea is that instead of focusing on adding more features (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/program_microsoft_windows_xp__box.jpg">Microsoft</a>), do a few things, and do them very well (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/ipod20.jpg">Apple</a>).</p>

<p>This is a great concept, focus on the user, focus on what the user spends most of their time doing and keep all the rest out-of-the-way. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit, I&#8217;m addicted to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000150.html">gold plating</a>. If I think it&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll add it, which is most certainly at conflict with this concept. This is one area were the two goals leave me quite torn, giving the user every feature possible versus a simple - even minimalistic interface.</p>

<p>All things considered though, this is where things are going. Simple, intuitive designs sell; it&#8217;s that simple. People expect technology of any form to fit in their lives, as simply as if it wasn&#8217;t even there. By building around the core of what the user does and minimizing fluff to enhance the user experience, you&#8217;re giving the end users what they want.</p>

<p>As written by <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v7i07_pfeiffer.html">Andreas Pfeiffer</a>, here are the 10 fundamental rules of Extreme Simplicity:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>More features isn&#8217;t better, it&#8217;s worse.</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#8217;t make things easier by adding to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Confusion is the ultimate deal-breaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Style matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Only features that provide a good user experience will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users.</p></li>
<li><p>Unused features are not only useless, they can slow you down and diminish ease of use.</p></li>
<li><p>Users do not want to think about technology: what really counts is what it does for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about the killer feature. Welcome to the age of the killer user-experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Less is difficult, that&#8217;s why less is more.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>We all know that users <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789723107/">don&#8217;t want to think</a>; this design philosophy further refines the concept and simplifies it to the point that it can be applied to almost any form of technology. By designing with a goal of maximizing simplicity, you create software that fits in the users&#8217; life, instead of fitting them into your product.</p>

<p>If you want your product to sell, find a way (though difficult it may be) for your product to be both indispensable and unobtrusive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My employer recently completed the final audit to confirm ISO 17799 compliance, the process was a real eye opener. In a process that should have been fairly short &amp; painless, the ordeal lasted close to a year, with me joining the company just before the second, and largest audit. That made my first few weeks rather <em>interesting</em>, to say the least.</p>

<p>While 17799 does have some complex requirements, most of the issues found had more to do with the overall mentality than with the true technical issues involved. The mentality at work tends to be to not seek what&#8217;s secure, but to find what works, and what&#8217;s fast - regardless of its impact. Without always being aware of the security issues involved, it&#8217;s easy to introduce significant vulnerabilities into a system.</p>

<p>There are three primary groups of thought when it comes to security:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Those that don&#8217;t know or care.
</strong>In the business world, these are by far the most common users, they don&#8217;t understand the implications and they typically want to keep it that way. These users introduce an amazing number of issues into a system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those that know, but don&#8217;t care enough to do things right.</strong>
These are less common, though they pose an equal, if not greater risk. When the pressure to have tasks done in an extremely short time is high enough, security shortcuts are often the result. While it typically doesn&#8217;t add significantly to time-lines, there is a time cost to ensuring that proper processes are followed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those that put security first.</strong>
This is the smallest group, though when equipped with the proper authority, can have the greatest impact. These rare people who both understand and care tend to carry the burden for the ignorance and laziness of the other major groups. It is there duty to see that data is secure, and systems are well protected against possible attacks.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Keeping a constant eye on security is critical, especially for developers - as our work can have an impact on such a large number of end users. Many developers tend to under-appreciate the impact they can have, both for the good their work does, and the harm their mistakes can cause. Finding a clear understanding of the implications of a decision is vitally important.</p>

<p>Even if you think something may not raise a security issue, take the time to evaluate the possibilities. Its well worth the time, trust me, <a href="http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Oct/1011994.html">I know this</a>. A single error on my part as to how the application needed to secure its data led to a public announcement of the issue to the famous BugTraq mailing list. A simple mistake, with a definite impact on how I view potential security issues.</p>

<p>Thankfully that issue was small enough that it didn&#8217;t cause any real harm, but it certainly taught me a lesson. In that decision, I didn&#8217;t consider the possible implications, it led to what I consider a rather public embarrassment.</p>

<p>Next time you work on a feature that could be abused in any way, take a few minutes to think about ways to make it safer and more secure. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later.</p>
