  <div class="entry-content"><p>Piracy is bad, right? Maybe not, and it seems Microsoft <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-micropiracy9apr09,0,414067.story">figured</a> <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/04/13/windows-vista-pirates-wont-get-fancy-graphics/"> it</a> <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+Can+we+check+your+software+license/2100-1016_3-5371664.html?tag=nl"> out</a>. Piracy can be indirectly profitable, both by giving you additional customers that you may collect from at some future point, and it also serves to reduce or limit the market share of rivals. Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, acknowledged this back in 1998 while speaking at the University of Washington, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>_&#8221;Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people don&#8217;t pay for the software. Someday they will, though,&#8230;&#8221; _</p></blockquote>

<p>_&#8221;And as long as they&#8217;re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They&#8217;ll get sort of addicted, and then we&#8217;ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.&#8221; _</p>

<p>While Microsoft claimed losses of $14 billion for 2005, there were also several benefits as a result, that Microsoft rarely acknowledges. Among these is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limiting growth of rival products</p></li>
<li><p>Locking users into Microsoft products</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing overall market-share</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing brand awareness</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Given the choice, I&#8217;m sure that Microsoft would rather see the $14 billion they claimed they lost, though in reality, I don&#8217;t believe the number would be that high. There is an unknown variable in the equation, when determining what the loss due to piracy is; the number of users that would have chosen the same product if they had to pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>Holding Linux Back</strong></p>

<p>Even though at least one Linux vendor <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39195424,00.htm">sees possible value</a> in piracy, for the most part Linux stands to lose the most. It has been <a href="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=170700943">shown</a> that cracking down on piracy actually helps Linux. Users they are either not fully locked in, or adding new systems tend to be looking towards Linux, instead of sticking with Windows and its related products due to the high costs involved.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a vested interest in limiting the market share of Linux, and it other competitors, keeping this in mind, it easy to understand some recent moves Microsoft has made. One of the more interesting is the decision to block pirates from using the new Aero shell in Windows Vista (there is also <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/08-10WinXPStarterFS.mspx">Windows XP Starter Edition</a> which is interesting in its own right). This begs the question, if Microsoft thinks they can stop pirates, why let them run the OS at all?</p>

<p><strong>Locking Users In</strong></p>

<p>While hard numbers aren&#8217;t easy to find, there are <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld/article/03/08/29/34FElinux_1.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2153346/migration-costs-holding-back">reports</a> on the expense of migrating from Windows to Linux. Regardless of TCO, ROI, any business metric, it can be safely acknowledged that it isn&#8217;t cheap to move an entire corporate network to a different platform. This fact is a key benefit for Microsoft, as many businesses may find it cheaper to just pay, than to switch platforms.</p>

<p>As an example, take this fictional Asian company, running purely on pirated software, here is the vital information about their network:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>400 PCs running Windows XP</p></li>
<li><p>18 Servers running Windows 2003 Server</p></li>
<li><p>250 PCs with Office 2003</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive use of Excel automation in critical business processes</p></li>
<li><p>Most data stored in 2 SQL Server 2005 servers</p></li>
<li><p>All email stored in Exchange server</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a nightmare to convert, the user re-training, data migration, re-development of business processes. Facing a crackdown on piracy, this fictional business would have little choice but to pay up for what they are using.</p>

<p>If you can lock users into your products, and then latter try to put pressure on them to pay for what they are using, you have a far better chance of seeing money, than if the users had went with a different platform from the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Cashing In</strong></p>

<p>Through the use of programs like the afore mentioned restriction on the use of the Aero shell, and the use of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.mspx?displaylang=en">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> program to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6868504/">restrict the use of Windows Update</a>, Microsoft can apply additional pressure on the users of pirated versions of its software. While most anti-piracy schemes have been cracked fairly quickly, it does add significant pressure to the &#8216;casual pirate&#8217; - home or corporate users that simply got a copy from a friend.</p>

<p>By leveraging legal pressure and user annoyance, you can slowly begin to reap in profits from these users, if you can avoid pushing them to another platform in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m always interested in better ways to produce documentation or demonstrations for my software. One method I&#8217;ve found to be rather impressive is desktop capture, generating a movie either in a streaming format, or in Flash. The drawback: Price. The tools used for this are often rather expensive, and on a tight budget they can push you to the limit quickly. There is another option though, <a href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>  - a free, cross-platform application that generates Flash demos and presentations.</p>

<p>From my short review, this seems like an excellent option, and the fact that it&#8217;s free just makes it even better.</p>

<p>I saw noticed an article on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/04/13/google-calendar-yahoo_cx_df_0413google.html">Forbes</a> mentioning the long rumored, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> , and sure enough! While I&#8217;ve not taken long to play with it, this, so far, seems to be very cool. I&#8217;ll post more after I play with it for a while.</p>

While it look it&#8217;s time about getting here, it finally arrived. The book, while not the full version, is larger than I expected, and looks like it should be worth reading. I&#8217;m a bit disappointed in how soon that the discount for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/">MCP</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-528.asp">exam</a> expires, as with the schedule I have for the desktop <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/25/mcts/">MCTS</a> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have time to make use of it.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of the best free offers I&#8217;ve seen Microsoft release. The offer is still open (closes the 17th), so if you&#8217;ve not signed up for yours - you should hurry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MONEY Magazine and Salary.com have announced their <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/">top 10 jobs</a>  in the country. While it&#8217;s no surprise to me, Software Engineer took the #1 spot. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>_<strong>Why it&#8217;s great</strong> Software engineers are needed in virtually every part of the economy, making this one of the fastest-growing job titles in the U.S. Even so, it&#8217;s not for everybody.</p></blockquote>

<p>Designing, developing and testing computer programs requires some pretty advanced math skills and creative problem-solving ability. If you&#8217;ve got them, though, you can work and live where you want: Telecommuting is quickly becoming widespread.</p>

<p>The profession skews young &#8211; the up-all-night-coding thing gets tired &#8211; but consulting and management positions aren&#8217;t hard to come by once you&#8217;re experienced.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s cool</strong> Cutting-edge projects, like designing a new video game or tweaking that military laser. Extra cash from freelance gigs. Plus, nothing says cool like great prospects.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s not</strong> Jobs at the biggest companies tend to be less creative (think Neo, pre-Matrix). Outsourcing is a worry. Eyestrain and back, hand and wrist problems are common._</p>

<p>Software development is certainly a great career, and here is yet more proof - from outside the industry.</p>
