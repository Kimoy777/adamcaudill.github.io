  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I was sent a link to Robert Cringely&#8217;s latest treatise:  <em><a href="http://www.cringely.com/2011/10/the-second-coming-of-java/">The second coming of Java</a></em> - and to say I disagreed was a bit of an understatement. To me, it represents a fundamental flaw in his perception of developers, and more importantly the economics of software development.</p>

<p>The key to Cringely&#8217;s argument comes down to this:</p>

<p>When SSDs gain enough capacity there will be a shift from the Ruby world back to the Java world. Not for prototyping, because, well, it’s prototyping. But simply because the statement “<strong>Ruby is <em>incredibly</em> slow but I don’t care because my database is slower</strong>” will no longer be true.</p>

<p>What he&#8217;s missing here is the real reason people use frameworks like Rails; it&#8217;s not about it being Ruby, or being the latest cool thing - it&#8217;s about developer productivity. That&#8217;s it, and that&#8217;s all there is to it - Rails allows a developer to do more in less time. That&#8217;s one of the key reasons so many Java web developers jumped ship (though I can think of a few others), and what pushed Microsoft to invest so heavily in their <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">MVC framework</a>.</p>

<p>I could fully rehash the argument, but in what I consider to be one of Jeff Atwood&#8217;s best articles,  <em><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/hardware-is-cheap-programmers-are-expensive.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></em>, he covers a key point to my argument - developer time is vastly more expensive than hardware. Atwood&#8217;s take on the issue is clear:</p>

<p>Clearly, <strong>hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive</strong>. Whenever you&#8217;re provided an opportunity to leverage that imbalance, it would be incredibly foolish not to.</p>

<p>When there&#8217;s a choice between developer productivity, and spending money on hardware - the conclusion should be the same. It&#8217;s much cheaper to throw more hardware at a slower framework than it is to invest more developer time in a faster framework. For any non-trivial application, throwing more front-end servers at it will always be cheaper than slowing the development process down with a non-productivity-centric toolkit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple economics; server hardware is getting faster and cheaper, developer time is only getting more expensive.</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-06T17:39:37-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 6<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently given the task of ensuring that a Silverlight+RIA application that could contain private information was secure for deployment to a public web site. So I started searching for automated pen-testing tools that could work against Microsoft&#8217;s Binary SOAP protocol (<code>msbin1</code>, a.k.a <code>application/soap+msbin1</code>) and found only disappointment. For various reasons, it&#8217;s significantly more complex to pen-test a application using <code>msbin1</code> than traditional <code>SOAP</code> + <code>WSDL</code>.</p>

<p>To properly test the services, I had to make a compromise: temporarily modify the application to expose a <code>SOAP</code> endpoint. While this changes the state of the application and thus reduces the validity of the tests, it does provide a reasonable way of testing the web services to ensure that they are behaving as intended.</p>

<p>The recently released <a href="http://www.soapui.org/About-SoapUI/go-pro.html">SoapUI Pro 4</a> adds new <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Security/getting-started.html">security testing tools</a> that makes this a viable (and attractive option). To get this working, there are a few small changes that need to be made to the solution:</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to add a reference to <code>Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.EndPoints</code> which is part of the RIA Services Toolkit; this allows you to expose different End Points for the service such as <code>SOAP</code> and <code>OData</code>.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to add the following <code>configSections</code> entry to your <code>Web.config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
 &lt;configSections&gt;
   &lt;sectionGroup name="system.serviceModel"&gt;
     &lt;section name="domainServices"
      type="System.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.DomainServicesSection,
      System.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting,
      Version=4.0.0.0,
      Culture=neutral,
      PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" /&gt;
   &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
 &lt;/configSections&gt;
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to expose the <code>SOAP</code> end point:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
 ...
 &lt;system.serviceModel&gt;
  ...
  &lt;domainServices&gt;
   &lt;endpoints&gt;
    &lt;add name="Soap"
     type="Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.SoapXmlEndpointFactory,
     Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting,
     Version=4.0.0.0,
     Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" /&gt;
   &lt;/endpoints&gt;
  &lt;/domainServices&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, just follow the <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Security/security-scans-overview.html">instructions</a> for SoapUI to setup your tests, and you can feel (just a little) more confident in your application. Passing with flying colors obviously doesn&#8217;t mean your application is bulletproof, but it helps to confirm that web service code is solid.</p>

<p>Now, while this does provide some insight into your application and should help find common issues, it&#8217;s not a replacement for a professional assessment by a qualified auditor. If you are handling credit cards or other highly targeted information, <em>please</em> consult a security specialist before a public deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another option is a <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp</a> plug-in offered by Gotham Digital Science, and can be found <a href="http://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2009/11/19/wcf-binary-soap-plug-in-for-burp.html">here</a>. It&#8217;s a more complex workflow, but allows testing without an exposed SOAP end-point - which is great if you don&#8217;t have source code access.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier today, the hacker collective <a href="http://lulzsecurity.com/">Lulz Security</a> released a batch of 62,156 email/password combinations from unknown sites; I decided to take a look at the data and see if there was anything to be learned from it.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>And as always, LulzSec delivers: <a href="http://t.co/yQlcu5x" title="http://www.mediafire.com/?9em5xp7r0rd2yod">mediafire.com/?9em5xp7r0rd2y…</a> 62,000+ emails/passwords just for you. Enjoy.</p>&mdash; The Lulz Boat (@LulzSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/LulzSec/status/81327464156119040">June 16, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>So, let&#8217;s take a look at a few stats:</p>

<p>Total Domains: ~5,230</p>

<p>Top 15 Domains:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-06-16_1922.png" alt="Top 15 Domains" /></p>

<p>There are over 50,000 unique passwords, but even with this many passwords, there&#8217;s still a few quite common - and very bad passwords in use:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-06-16_1936.png" alt="Top Passwords" /></p>

<p>While this is a fairly small release, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/">LulzSec</a> twitter stream has a number of entries like these:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>There is some very angry level 85 WoW player cutting his wrists right now, thanks to @<a href="https://twitter.com/miraclejoe">miraclejoe</a> and LulzSec. Let it flow&#8230;</p>&mdash; The Lulz Boat (@LulzSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/LulzSec/status/81334551686815745">June 16, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>There are several tweets about people accessing Facebook, Twitter, and even Amazon accounts - what&#8217;s so unfortunate here is that service providers could easily restrict accounts on lists like this to protect the users and greatly reduce the impact of these breaches.</p>

<p>Until people learn that password reuse is dangerous, this will keep happening.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I&#8217;ve removed a link to a tweet, as the account has since been removed. The tweet said: &#8220;@LulzSec Cheers for the paypal account with £250 in it! ;)&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, the latest version of my favorite forum software, bbPress, was <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2011/05/bbpress-2-0-beta-1/">released</a>. While this is a beta and not a final release, it&#8217;s still a major event for the project: this release is in the form of a WordPress plugin, instead of a stand-alone application as it&#8217;s been in the past. In December 2009 <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/12/16/bbpress-is-the-end-near/">I wrote about this decision</a> - and at the time I was rather disappointed with the change in direction; but now my views have changed. I&#8217;m also excited to see that <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and his company, <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> have decided to invest the time and money needed to make this happen; there for a while it looked like bbPress really was dying.</p>

<p>Thanks to services like <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> and its numerous clones, it seems the days of standalone forums are numbered; when combined with the increasing strength of WordPress as a full-blown CMS, this move actually makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited both as a user and developer - this opens many new doors from both perspectives, and will certainly increase adoption of the software, as integration with the current version is <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2011/03/06/bbpress-wordpress-3-1-registration-issues/">a bit tricky</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the entire team on this release; it really is a major milestone for the project!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I saw a post on Facebook by a friend of mine, <a href="http://inotifythoughtschanging.net/blog/">Anthony Green</a>, about writing his first blog post as a Microsoft employee (he has a personal blog as well, unfortunately he&#8217;s not written anything since 2008) - when I saw the title, I couldn&#8217;t believe it was 20 years already - seems just yesterday that I wrote about its <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/27/happy-belated-birthday-vb/">15th birthday</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbteam/archive/2011/05/20/happy-20th-birthday-visual-basic.aspx">Happy 20th Birthday Visual Basic!</a></p>

<p>My, what a journey it&#8217;s been. Almost fifteen years ago I randomly bought a copy of &#8220;Visual Basic 5: Deluxe Learning Edition&#8221; - I was just 15 at the time and wanted a new hobby, and writing software seemed like it would be fun. In those early days, I had no idea what career I would choose, and really didn&#8217;t intend for software development to become the dominant force in my life - I just wanted a better, more productive way to spend my time during the summer.</p>

<p>In the years that have went by, I became passionate about the field, and all it encompasses (possible obsessed, if you believe my wife) - it&#8217;s been the driving force in my life. Today, I manage a team of 6 developers, and have a fun start-up with some friends (that someday won&#8217;t cost me money every month) - and all because I bought that book. Overall, I have a lot to thank VB for, it really did get me started in this field.</p>

<p>Today though, my language of choice has moved on to newer options - I prefer bleeding technologies when I can use them - but VB will always have a place in my heart, and I&#8217;ll always follow its progress as it continues to transform and adapt to an ever-changing world. As the most popular .NET language (contrary to what many of the C# developers think), it plays a vital role in the development of the framework and the ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the conversations I&#8217;ve had with Anthony about the future of the language, I greatly look forward to writing about its 25th birthday; I expect those will be exciting times for the language and the entire .NET ecosystem.</p>
