  <div class="entry-content"><p>WikiLeaks has a growing issue that could easily lead to its downfall, and that problem is its leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. As time goes on, he is becoming the persona of the organization, and as this happens he becomes more of a target, and more of a threat to the organization&#8217;s stability. There are rumors of death threats and assassination plots, on top on the fact that he is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange">wanted</a> in Sweden for what he has claimed to be trumped-up charges. Those that seek to stop WikiLeaks are increasingly attacking Assange directly, and focusing less on those behind the scenes or the organization itself. One outspoken leader doesn&#8217;t make the organization.</p>

<p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him <em>as</em> WikiLeaks. If he was arrested today, how much faith would there be in WikiLeaks? I am sure that they have developed contingency plans should something happen to Assange, but those plans will likely do little to promote faith and trust, or to calm the media firestorm that would surely erupt.</p>

<p>For WikiLeaks to survive the trials that it will soon face, they need to ensure that there is a strong governance body in place controlling the organization. For their mission to continue, they must become more than just Julian Assange to the public. Trust is <em>the</em> key asset for WikiLeaks, and if that trust is lost, then few will accept the authenticity of their releases; they must take steps to preserve that trust.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple weeks ago, Hulu Plus shed its beta tag and opened to the general public. When this happened, the price was changed and a new one week free trial was added. As a subscriber I was happy to hear about the new lower price, though my main concern was wondering if I would have to contact them to get the price break. That concern, thankfully, was the furthest thing from the truth. Soon as the news hit, I found this email waiting for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Adam,</p>

<p>Thanks for being a subscriber to Hulu Plus during our preview. We&#8217;ve been hard at work refining our existing applications, expanding the device coverage, and extending our content lineup. We&#8217;re excited to announce that today, Hulu Plus is officially launching out of preview to anyone in the U.S. for just $7.99/month.</p>

<p><strong>Since we&#8217;re now offering Hulu Plus at a lower price than during the preview, your subscription fee has been lowered to $7.99/month, and on your next billing cycle, we&#8217;ll also automatically credit your account with $2 for each month you&#8217;ve been a subscriber. In addition, we&#8217;re now offering a 1-week free trial for all new subscribers, so we&#8217;ll be issuing you an additional $2 credit since the free trial wasn&#8217;t in place during the preview.</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;d also like to offer you the chance to earn more free time on Hulu Plus by helping us spread the word about the service. For each friend who uses your referral to join Hulu Plus, we&#8217;ll give you two additional weeks for free, up to 20 weeks total. Each of your referrals will also receive two weeks free on their first month&#8217;s subscription. For more details on the program and to invite your friends, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals?src=plus_launch">http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Hulu Plus preview began, we&#8217;ve added more TV shows and extended our device coverage. To see which shows are now available on Hulu Plus, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#content">http://www.hulu.com/plus/content</a>, and to see the most up-to-date list of supported TVs, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes, mobile phones, and tablets visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#devices">http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting us during the Hulu Plus preview. We look forward to continuing to work on your behalf in the months and years to come.</p>

<p>The Hulu Team</p></blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added)</p>

<p>This is about the last thing I expected, especially from a company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu#History">backed</a> by major media players. I would hate to imaging how much this move cost them, but I know it bought them plenty of loyalty; it&#8217;s rare to to see companies go out of their way to be fair to customers, and even moreso when it means giving back money they&#8217;ve already collected. If you want to win the hearts of your customers, this is the kind of move that does it.</p>

<p>If you change the price on a service or application – how will you current customers feel? Will they feel cheated for being an early adopter? It&#8217;s your current customers that will bring in new customers; make sure you take good care of them, and they will take care of you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recent release of <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/">diplomatic cables</a> by WikiLeaks has caused many to stop and think - which is always a good thing in my opinion. Of the many comments I&#8217;ve seen on this subject, one by Jeff Atwood seems to be the most relevant:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;WikiLeaks is preaching a message I&#8217;ve always practiced: there should be no difference between internal and external communication&#8221; (<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/statuses/9505496079798272#">twitter</a>)</em></p>

<p>Be it for a personal vendetta, political reasons, or perhaps just the love of chaos; there is always somebody that would love to take your secrets &amp; thoughtless words and expose them to the world. Even with the best security systems that the US Government could build, one person that wanted it all exposed was able to leak hundreds of thousands of documents before <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8166395/Bradley-Manning-The-prime-suspect-of-giving-files-to-WikiLeaks.html">exposing himself</a> and ending his crusade.</p>

<p>We should all be taking at least some precautions to protect our private communications, ensuring we use SSL wherever possible, avoiding unencrypted wireless networks, encrypting sensitive data and the like. By making a few smart decisions our secrets are a little safer, but there’s always the risk that there will be an insider ready and waiting. Anytime there is <em>interesting </em>communication, there will be people who want to see it exposed.</p>

<p>In my current position, I tend to see a lot of dirty laundry go through my inbox – nothing illegal, but some things that could certainly be embarrassing. At times I’m amazed that people would type some of the things that they do, both our clients and internally. If they had been a little more careful about what they said, nobody would ever care; but as it stands, if publicly released they could lead to a real black-eye on somebody’s reputation.</p>

<p>To minimize exposure to these risks, words should be carefully chosen and the impact of public disclosure always considered.</p>

<p>Obviously though, there are times that the subject is sensitive and that is simply unavoidable. All one can do is take all the reasonable precautions and carefully consider the impact of their words, should they be exposed to the rest of the world.</p>

On Monday, August 2nd 2010 at 11:16 PM, Christopher Adam Caudill was born.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces and 19.25 inches, born just 24 minutes after our arrival at the hospital. He was born almost a month early, and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, in addition to having issues maintaining his body temperature (as is common with babies born early). Thankfully, the next day the pneumonia diagnosis was withdrawn and his body temperature stabilized.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, both mother and baby were discharged with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>(Sorry for not posting this sooner, decided it would be best to drop off the radar until things calmed down.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine my surprise when one of my developers mentions he has a virus and I see this on his screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010/07/IMG_20100726_163201.jpg.scaled1000-300x224.jpg" alt="" />
No, the items listed aren&#8217;t the issue, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Tool">Security Tool</a> that&#8217;s the virus. It&#8217;s vicious, plain and simple. It prevents almost all software from running (either by presenting a &#8220;virus warning&#8221; or simply killing the process), presents fake BSODs, and who knows what else that we didn&#8217;t notice. Only Explorer and Internet Explorer were operational, all other software was disabled.</p>

<p>As soon as the issue was found, the workstation was removed from the network while we attempted a clean-up via <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a> and a couple other similar tools. After running a scan from each tool in safe-mode it looked like we had it beat. We were wrong. The next reboot, and it was back - I&#8217;m not surprised but somewhat disappointed that none of the tools actually performed the cleanup correctly. There are several routes it could have taken to ensure that it would re-infect on boot, seems at least one of those was missed.</p>

<p>The one saving grace is that for some reason, it doesn&#8217;t attack while in safe-mode. Had this not been the case, data recovery would have been far more time consuming than it was (about four hours). Once the data was secured and logs and various backups for later analysis were captured, the workstation was re-imaged. In total, probably 30 hours were lost among development, technicians, and networking - not to mention the time spent by the security team members. A rather costly exercise, all things considered.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still one question floating around - how did this happen? The workstation in question was running a fully patched Windows XP install, Symantec Corporate anti-virus with the latest updates, behind a firewall and content filters, yet it still happened. How did our pricey anti-virus solution not detect this? Why didn&#8217;t it detect anything at all?</p>

<p>It amazes me that here in 2010 we still have to worry about computer viruses (or virii, if you prefer); but I find it utterly unacceptable that that a top-tier, fully managed and updated anti-virus product allows such a debilitating pile of code to execute. Computer science has made amazing strides and modern PC hardware has more than enough resources to perform more intense analysis and monitoring - yet it still happened.</p>

<p>Have we actually lost this battle?</p>
