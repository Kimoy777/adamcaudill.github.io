  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a somewhat (but not entirely) surprising <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">announcement</a>, Google is removing support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a> video from Chrome. This change to their implementation of the often controversial HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is both a major step by Google and a furtherance of the already complicated world of video online.</p>

<p><em>&#8230; To that end, we are changing Chrome’s HTML5  support to make it consistent with the codecs already supported by the open Chromium project. Specifically, we are supporting the WebM (VP8) and Theora video codecs, and will consider adding support for other high-quality open codecs in the future. Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, <strong>support for the codec will be removed</strong> and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies.</em></p>

<p>When Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/19/webm-google-h-264/">released</a> <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> (a royalty-free codec which Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/google-acquires-video-compression-technology-company-on2-for-106-million/">acquired</a> as part of On2), it was clear that the intention was to take on H.264 and with this move there seems little doubt that the gauntlet has been thrown down. Although, now that H.264 has such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/">strong base</a> (it&#8217;s included in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html">Flash</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/29/html5-video.aspx">IE9</a>, Safari, Mobile Safari, and Android), it really makes one wonder if Google has picked a fight that has long since been lost.</p>

<p><strong>So why would Google do this?</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my best guess: Money (specifically, patent licensing).</p>

<p>H.264 is heavily encumbered by numerous patents owned by companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco, and controlled by <a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx">MPEG LA</a>, the consortium charged with turning these patents into profit (<a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avc-att1.pdf">here&#8217;s</a> the 70 page list of patents for those interested). While I&#8217;m sure many people recall that MPEG LA made a very public pledge that H.264 would be <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/mpeg-la-h-264-streaming-will-be-free-forever/">free forever</a>, as is often the case, things aren&#8217;t quite that simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06696465857424753507">Peter Csathy</a> wrote a fairly <a href="http://digitalmediaupdate.blogspot.com/2010/09/think-h264-is-now-royalty-free-think.html">detailed post</a> on the matter, pointing out some key details that many in the media skipped. Here&#8217;s the core of what wasn&#8217;t discussed after the MPEG LA announcement (but should have been):</p>

<p><em>But, you say, MPEG LA recently announced that it will no longer charge royalties for the use of H.264. Yes, it’s true – MPEG LA recently bowed to mounting pressure from, and press surrounding, WebM and announced something that kind of sounds that way. But, I caution you to read the not-too-fine print. H.264 is royalty-free only in one limited case – for Internet video that is delivered free to end users. Read again: <strong><strong>for (1) Internet delivery that is (2) delivered free to end users</strong></strong>. In the words of MPEG LA’s own press release, “Products and services other than [those] continue to be royalty-bearing.”</em></p>

<p><a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s VP of Engineering offer&#8217;s a somewhat similar take in &#8221;<a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/08/27/free-as-in-smokescreen/">Free as in Smokescreen</a>:&#8221;</p>

<p><em>What MPEG-LA announced is that their current moratorium on charging fees for the <strong>transmission of H.264 content</strong>, previously extended through 2015 for uses that don’t charge users, is now permanent. You still have to pay for a license for H.264 if you want to make things that create it, consume it, or your business model for distributing it is direct rather than indirect.</em></p>

<p><em>What they’ve made permanently free is distribution of content that people have already licensed to encode, and will need a license to decode. This is similar to Nikon announcing that they will not charge you if you put your pictures up on Flickr, or HP promising that they will never charge you additionally if you photocopy something that you printed on a LaserJet.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for one of the licensors to reinterpret the license and claim that ads constitute a form of payment or some similar excuse to exclude them from the exception they granted. I&#8217;ve yet to get my hands on the latest licensing agreement to see exactly what it says about this, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to see this card played at some point to wring extra revenue from these patents.</p>

<p>Given that Google owns the massive video sharing site YouTube, which <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html">uses H.264</a>, plus whatever unknown projects relating to <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> - it stands to reason that Google would certainly save some money by moving away from such an encumbered technology; not to mention avoid future risk should rules change. Though personally, I also have to wonder if it could be fears of a repeat of the <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/archives/">GIF patent</a> debacle.</p>

<p><strong>Now where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>Right now HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> is a mess, at best. There is a war for which codec becomes the de facto standard, and there is a <em>lot</em> of money at stake depending on who wins. At this point there is no single codec that works across all major browsers; to get full coverage the best option now looks to be a combination of H.264, WebM, and Flash. Doesn&#8217;t really sound like the progress that was promised with HTML5 does it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting though that Google isn&#8217;t the first browser developer to reject H.264; both <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/01/23/html5-video-and-codecs/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/12/31/re-introducing-video">Opera</a> have decided against including it in their browsers as well. As painful as the fragmentation is now in regard to who supports what, this move by Google actually does little to change the landscape. Support has been fragmented from the beginning, and all this really does it push H.264 a step away from being the de facto standard; a title that it has been very close to seizing.</p>

<p>Had Firefox added support for H.264, I think the fight would be over and would have made today&#8217;s announcement almost suicidal for the project. Though with such a major player holding out against it, Google&#8217;s move becomes a minor tactical shift in the short-term (though the long-term impact could be significant).</p>

<p>I could go on for pages about what works are where we are now, but <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> (an infinitely better writer than I) sums it all up here: &#8221;<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#what-works">Dive into HTML5: Video on the Web</a>&#8221; - well worth reading if you want to really understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>So in summary - video needs to be encoded to multiple formats, which today&#8217;s announcement does little to alter due to the fragmentation that was already in place. In the long run, WebM may be better for the community due to its license, though many of the internet&#8217;s biggest players have a vested interest in H.264. So when you factor in politics and propaganda between competing companies, distrust, and possible patent claims that haven&#8217;t been addressed yet; this all leads me to an even simpler summary:</p>

<p>Yesterday, HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> was a mess; tomorrow it will still be a mess.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I get started, let me make a couple of things clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple is evil; pure and simple. I&#8217;m fully convinced that Steve Jobs has weekly planning meetings with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> himself1.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s policies are anti-everybody. From bloggers to developers2, Apple seems to make life as hard as possible for those that use their products for profit.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With these facts in mind, I tend to shy away from their products when I have a choice (which isn&#8217;t always <a href="http://shadowofthebat.com/2010/12/05/buying-a-macbook-from-cowboom-com/">the case</a>); though a while back I decided to buy an iPad for some reason. I&#8217;ve wanted a tablet for quite some time, and despite my hopes of there being a Microsoft-based solution that would do what I needed, there wasn&#8217;t anything announced that had the features I wanted in a price range that I could justify.</p>

<p>When I first powered it up and was met by that familiar instruction to connect to iTunes, I was really questioning the wisdom of buying an Apple product. But, I took a deep breath, installed iTunes and took the plunge.</p>

<p>That was about 3 months ago, and I no longer question the wisdom – it was a great purchase, and has become a key part of how I work. Between my favorite applications (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a>, and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a>), I&#8217;ve been able to streamline my workflow, keep better notes, and keep the information that I need available – no matter when or where I need it.</p>

<p>The device itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology">ingeniously</a>) designed, with Apple&#8217;s typical focus on simplicity first and foremost. It has a ~10-hour battery life ensures that you&#8217;ll make it through the work day (and probably with enough left to do some reading after work); though your PC probably won&#8217;t be able to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060">charge it</a>. The only thing missing from a hardware perspective is a &#8216;back&#8217; button, as I would quite likely use that more than the &#8216;home&#8217; button.</p>

<p>I was quite concerned initially that it would be like so many other devices and gadgets that I&#8217;ve acquired other the years, interesting for a couple of weeks then doomed to spend the rest of its life buried in one of my &#8216;junk&#8217; boxes. Within the first few hours I was sure that wouldn&#8217;t be its fate; far from it. At this point I rarely leave home without it, even if only going shopping. While I do still rely on my Moto DROID for a number of things, I&#8217;ve found that the iPad does a much better job at serving most of the roles my phone was once responsible for.</p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> – it&#8217;s by far my favorite service and I access it from every device I have. Prior to the iPad I often took notes on the DROID to avoid having to use hand-written notes that would need to be transcribed later; thanks to its small screen and tiny keyboard my notes were as terse as I could get them, often missing details I later wished I had. With the large screen and large, better designed keyboard of the iPad, I&#8217;ve found my notes are now clearer and more detailed – exactly what I need them to be.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who bought one shortly after they came out referred to it as a media consumption device, not suited for work or anything serious. While this is what I expected, it&#8217;s not what I found; it&#8217;s a great media player (despite the lack of a 16:9 screen) and thanks to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8">Kindle</a> application, it&#8217;s also a very good e-reader, but with the right applications it has a strong business side as well.</p>

<p>What I feared would be a toy relegated to the abyss of abandoned gadgets has turned into a key tool helping me keep my chaotic life in order.</p>

<p>1Before anybody says anything, yes, this is just a joke.
2While Apple has made a lot of <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/09/apple-opens-app-store-to-other-development-platforms-publishes-review-guidelines/">progress</a> in opening up and making rules more clear, though they could still do better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had a great idea; a trip down to Florida to visit family and celebrate our second anniversary - the idea turned out to be a bit less great than I had hoped. Of the seven days we were there, on three the wind-chill was less than 40F. On the upside, I had booked a room at a newer (opened in 2006) 4-star hotel; if we&#8217;re going to be stuck inside, no reason not to be in a great room.</p>

<p>The hotel was <a href="http://www.rosenshinglecreek.com/">Rosen Shingle Creek</a>, a rather large (1,500 rooms plus a 450,000 sq. ft. conference area) and quite impressive facility. The view as you drive up to the main entrance is most impressive; 14-stories tall and inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Revival_architecture">Spanish Colonial Revival</a> architecture that was so popular in Florida during the early 1900s. As you approach the hotel, you&#8217;ll notice that the driveway is offset to the left to enhance the initial impression.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26686573@N00/4693535920/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4693535920_4e031719ea.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The rooms are well-appointed, and well designed. The use of art by a local photographer (which is featured throughout the hotel) seems, to me at least, far better than the random paintings and abstract art I&#8217;ve seen at most other hotels I&#8217;ve been to recently. As would be expected from a 4-star hotel, the beds are comfortable; though personally I believe that the beds at the nearby <a href="http://www.renaissanceseaworldorlando.com/">Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld</a> are far superior.</p>

<p>The hotel&#8217;s public spaces are nearly as impressive as its exterior appearance, with abundant marble and stonework, and large open spaces. It is certainly an upscale hotel, and you are reminded of that fact each and every step of the way.</p>

<p>Though with this praise, there are a few things I really didn&#8217;t care for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parking: Valet parking is a steep $20/day; there is the option to self-park for $12/day, but in the evening the parking lot fills quickly. If the thought of walking close to a half-mile at the end of a long day walking around theme parks seems like a bad idea, then I would avoid the self-parking.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet: The lack of in-room Wi-Fi is (in my opinion) inexcusable for such a new hotel. Between my wife and me, there were three laptops and two iPads; so a single wired internet connection just doesn&#8217;t cut it. I don&#8217;t mind paying the $13/day they change for internet access (well, I do mind, but there&#8217;s little choice but to live with it), but I need to be able to use it the way I want to use it. In a world where more and more devices come with Wi-Fi built-in, there&#8217;s no reason for any hotel to not provide in-room Wi-Fi access.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning: The room was nearly spotless when we arrived (and what little was missed was quite excusable), and the daily cleaning was always courteous and thorough. Some other areas though, didn&#8217;t receive the same level of attention. For example, the in the hallway leading to our room there were scraps of paper and other debris on the floor for almost the entire time we were there. Not a huge deal, but if they only vacuum the hallway once a week – what else are they not doing right?</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: I don&#8217;t mind tipping for good service (and I tend to be more generous than most), but I can&#8217;t stand people who demand tips. I&#8217;ve not seen people push for tips like that in a long time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a nice hotel and I wouldn&#8217;t suggest avoiding it; though there are better hotels in the area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a project coming up that will require some iOS development – which means that it has to be done on a Mac. Seeing as I didn&#8217;t own a Mac, and as the more I spent on acquiring one, the less money from this project will end up in my pocket; I needed a cheap solution. In the end I acquired a very nice 13&#8221; MacBook from CowBoom.com; so this is both about the deals that are available and a review of my experience with the seller.</p>

<p>The Options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Retail: It is well-known that Apple rarely allows discounts; and when they do permit them, they are typically small. It&#8217;s possible to save a few dollars by buying through Amazon (i.e. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC516LL-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002C7489S/">here</a>) or the like, but the savings is likely to be in the 5% range.</p></li>
<li><p>Hackintosh: For those not familiar, a hackintosh is a PC running a modified version of OS X to bypass hardware restrictions. Lifehacker has a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5672051/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-mac-and-install-os-x-in-eight-easy-steps">hackintosh guide</a>that details all of the steps and hardware necessary to get it all working. Per the Lifehacker guide, it&#8217;s a little over $900 once you figure in sales tax (if you&#8217;re unlucky enough to live in TN as I do); by switching out a few parts (case, power supply, HDD), the price with taxes drops to a little over $800. This though, has a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Legality: Doing this violates the OS X license agreement, which is kinda significant.</p></li>
<li><p>Support: There is none, period. Your best bet is posting to forums and hoping that others have seen the issue before.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency: Seeing as these boxes run a modified kernel, it&#8217;s possible that these modifications could lead to inconsistent behavior between them and a real Mac; when you are writing software, this could be a big deal.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates: Apple has already intentionally <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/10/31/hackintosh-netbook-users-take-note-snow-leopard-10-6-2-update-kills-support-for-atom-processor/">broken</a>support for Intel Atom processors to combat Hackintosh Netbooks which were becoming quite popular. You never know what they&#8217;ll try to break in future updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware: Seeing this isn&#8217;t a supported configuration, hardware support is iffy at best. You have to carefully select what hardware will be used; ideally duplicating someone else&#8217;s tested and confirmed-working build.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>eBay: I spent the better part of a weekend looking through hundreds of listings; researching specs and features, comparing prices, and analyzing feedback. As is expected with eBay, there&#8217;s a bit of everything: items beat to death, broken, way overpriced, or great deals that get snapped up almost as soon as you see them. The only thing missing is any form of consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Craigslist/etc.: Quite similar to eBay, except with somewhat better prices and fewer choices.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After pouring way too many hours into the search, I ran across a post on slickdeals.net mentioning that CowBoom.com had a <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/product/715713">good deal</a> on them. I&#8217;d never heard of them, and thinking them to be something of a joke thanks to the terrible name (my odd hatred of cows notwithstanding), but given the lack of progress – off I went to do some research. It turns out ta CowBoom was <a href="http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y10/m04/i12/s01">developed</a> by Dealtree, which BestBuy acquired in 2008; if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that there are backed by a major player, I would have just went on and ignored them.</p>

<p>Dealtree is effectively the liquidation arm of BestBuy, responsible for converting returns, damaged items, and the like into cash via different outlets; the better items go to CowBoom to be sold or auctioned.</p>

<p>When you buy something from CowBoom, you are presented with a list of individual units which includes a list of what&#8217;s included or missing, its condition, and any inspection notes. You can go through this list to pick the one that looks best, and that&#8217;s the one that will be shipped to you. It&#8217;s a fairly nice system, though prices should be carefully checked; I&#8217;ve seen items that were several years old going for more than the current version as well as items going for more than retail (though this seems to be a fairly rare case).</p>

<p>After looking at their prices and the unit description ($689 for the current MacBook [$750 after taxes]), and seeing the 30-day <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/rma/">return policy</a> – I decided that was the best route to go. So on the 19th I placed the order. Overall, I felt like I was getting a good deal and was rather happy.</p>

<p>This is where the warm-fuzzy starts to fade.</p>

<p>Despite ordering on the 19th, the package wasn&#8217;t actually shipped until the 27th. It finally arrived on the 3rd, 14 days after being ordered; it came from California though I often have better turn-around times with packages coming from China. Needless to say, the shipping was a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Knowing that it was likely a retail return certainly left me a bit wary, but being tested (or so they say) and covered by a no-questions-asked return policy made me more confident that in the end I would have a decent unit. It was packed quite securely, and I was quite relieved to discover that the laptop was in the original package; I pulled it out of the box and was surprised that it was in perfect condition, and that the power cord was still sealed with the original packaging. Jackpot. It would have cost me more than $1,100 after taxes to buy that same laptop from Apple.</p>

<p>The feeling of victory quickly faded though; I pressed the power button and nothing happened. No lights, no sound, nothing. After plugging it in, it booted up immediately; most laptops I&#8217;ve purchased were shipped at least partially changed so this seemed a bit odd to me. Being suspicious, I checked the battery information – it wasn&#8217;t charging and was only showing 1 charge cycle. Now I know why it was returned.</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable couple hours as I researched and tested different solutions; though after resetting the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964">SMC</a> multiple times and numerous reboots – it started working. I&#8217;ve been using it pretty heavily over the last couple days while configuring it for development, since getting through that fist issue there&#8217;s been no problems at all.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve got a new MacBook that&#8217;s in great condition with no issues for well under retail. Was the time and trouble worth it? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p><em>[Note: I apologize for the excessive length of this post; I originally intended to only write a few brief paragraphs, not a 1,100+ word essay. Perhaps now that I&#8217;m primarily writing code in C#, that tendency to verbosity that I learned from my Visual Basic days is expressing itself in my writing. After writing this I showed it to my wife and asked if it was too long; she quickly glanced to the bottom and asked where the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button was. Point made quite clearly. I will endeavor for brevity in the future for posts such as this. If you have made it this far, please give yourself a cookie for me, you deserve it.]</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WikiLeaks has a growing issue that could easily lead to its downfall, and that problem is its leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. As time goes on, he is becoming the persona of the organization, and as this happens he becomes more of a target, and more of a threat to the organization&#8217;s stability. There are rumors of death threats and assassination plots, on top on the fact that he is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange">wanted</a> in Sweden for what he has claimed to be trumped-up charges. Those that seek to stop WikiLeaks are increasingly attacking Assange directly, and focusing less on those behind the scenes or the organization itself. One outspoken leader doesn&#8217;t make the organization.</p>

<p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him <em>as</em> WikiLeaks. If he was arrested today, how much faith would there be in WikiLeaks? I am sure that they have developed contingency plans should something happen to Assange, but those plans will likely do little to promote faith and trust, or to calm the media firestorm that would surely erupt.</p>

<p>For WikiLeaks to survive the trials that it will soon face, they need to ensure that there is a strong governance body in place controlling the organization. For their mission to continue, they must become more than just Julian Assange to the public. Trust is <em>the</em> key asset for WikiLeaks, and if that trust is lost, then few will accept the authenticity of their releases; they must take steps to preserve that trust.</p>
