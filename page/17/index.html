  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently discovered that I had left the changer for my BlackBerry Tour behind (I&#8217;m in the process of moving, and left my changer at the old house), and needed a new one that night. So being late in the evening, my only option was a trip to the local Wal-Mart were I found the typical cheap off-brand charger for a somewhat pricey $15.</p>

<p>Had the quality been better, I wouldn&#8217;t have given it a second thought - but I&#8217;ve purchased a number of those changers in the past and they are poorly made and it never fails that they break within a few months.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011/02/lg420g-114x150.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking around I noticed a Tracfone package on the shelf that included a LG420G phone, a micro-USB wall charger (LG branded), a micro-USB car charger, and some other things (phone case, etc.), and all for <strong><em>$15</em></strong>. So for the same price as the cheap off-brand charger, I could get both a car and wall charger (both of better quality than the off-brand that Wal-Mart sells).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s a better deal to by a cheap pre-paid phone and toss the phone than it is to just buy the charger. Kinda crazy, but true.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had an idea for a small web application, and seeing as I&#8217;ve not spent as much time as I&#8217;ve wanted to using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> - I opted to build it the latest version of Rails. A decision that caused far more grief than I expected.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?485850">Dreamhost&#8217;s</a> PS offering (a managed VPS for those that don&#8217;t know), the seemingly simple task of getting a Rails 3 application up and running is actually quite complex. The root cause of this is that Dreamhost&#8217;s OS image is based on Debian <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/">etch</a>, which was released in April 2009 and has since been replaced; which means etch has become fairly outdated.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the process I used, and so far it seems to be working quite well:</p>

<p><strong>Domain Setup:</strong></p>

<p>When adding your domain to the Dreamhost panel, you&#8217;ll want to enable <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger">Passenger</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-01-28_0048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once your application is uploaded to the server, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a particularly unhelpful error message (something like <code>uninitialized constant Bundler</code>) from Passenger (or perhaps just a 500 error page).</p>

<p><strong>Server Updates:</strong></p>

<p>This is where the work starts, and gets somewhat ugly. As a warning, it&#8217;s quite possible that you could damage your configuration doing this; though thankfully you can <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.reboot&amp;">restore</a> your server to a working state within a few minutes from the Dreamhost panel should something go wrong. You&#8217;ll also need to have an <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.adminusers&amp;">admin user</a> for this task, as much of what needs to be done has to be done as root.</p>

<p>First step: Get your PS up to date; even after performing a restore on my server, there were a number of updates that are available to be installed. So let&#8217;s start off by getting those out of the way.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get past those three commands, the next step is to update SQLite to the latest version, as the version Dreamhost uses is quite old and won&#8217;t work with Rails 3.0 (well, to be accurate it won&#8217;t work with the latest version of sqlite3-ruby, which is the default database provider for Rails 3).</p>

<pre><code>wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
tar zxvf sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
cd sqlite-autoconf-3070400
sudo ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --libdir=/usr/lib
sudo make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t update SQLite you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... yes
checking for rb_proc_arity()... no
checking for sqlite3_initialize()... no
sqlite3-ruby only supports sqlite3 versions 3.6.16+, please upgrade!
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>or if you install the updated version, but don&#8217;t force it to <code>/usr/lib</code> you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... no
sqlite3 is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal' or 'yum
install sqlite3-devel'
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>Once that is taken care of SQLite, the rest is easy.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
</code></pre>

<p>At this point if you visit your new Rails site, it <em>should</em> be working!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve not tested this extensively, and I&#8217;ve no idea if this breaks anything. All I can say for certain, if that all of <em>my</em> sites still work, but your mileage may vary. <Disclaimer /></p></li>
<li><p>I was a fairly early Dreamhost PS adopter, and part way through this process I reset my server to get it back to a clean state. After resetting, I noticed some differences with the behavior of <code>apt-get</code> (404s on <code>update</code> and <code>upgrade</code> are gone), so for other early adopters it may be necessary to perform a reset to get your servers configuration in-sync with the latest official setup.</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#8217;t say for a fact that this is completely necessary, though you&#8217;ll likely need to selectively update a few packages if you skip this step. Also, for me, <code>gem</code> was broken until I ran <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://matthewjlittle.com/">Matt</a> for helping me get this working; troubleshooting the SQLite install was more than a little time consuming.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a somewhat (but not entirely) surprising <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">announcement</a>, Google is removing support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a> video from Chrome. This change to their implementation of the often controversial HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is both a major step by Google and a furtherance of the already complicated world of video online.</p>

<p><em>&#8230; To that end, we are changing Chrome’s HTML5  support to make it consistent with the codecs already supported by the open Chromium project. Specifically, we are supporting the WebM (VP8) and Theora video codecs, and will consider adding support for other high-quality open codecs in the future. Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, <strong>support for the codec will be removed</strong> and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies.</em></p>

<p>When Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/19/webm-google-h-264/">released</a> <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> (a royalty-free codec which Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/google-acquires-video-compression-technology-company-on2-for-106-million/">acquired</a> as part of On2), it was clear that the intention was to take on H.264 and with this move there seems little doubt that the gauntlet has been thrown down. Although, now that H.264 has such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/">strong base</a> (it&#8217;s included in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html">Flash</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/29/html5-video.aspx">IE9</a>, Safari, Mobile Safari, and Android), it really makes one wonder if Google has picked a fight that has long since been lost.</p>

<p><strong>So why would Google do this?</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my best guess: Money (specifically, patent licensing).</p>

<p>H.264 is heavily encumbered by numerous patents owned by companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco, and controlled by <a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx">MPEG LA</a>, the consortium charged with turning these patents into profit (<a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avc-att1.pdf">here&#8217;s</a> the 70 page list of patents for those interested). While I&#8217;m sure many people recall that MPEG LA made a very public pledge that H.264 would be <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/mpeg-la-h-264-streaming-will-be-free-forever/">free forever</a>, as is often the case, things aren&#8217;t quite that simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06696465857424753507">Peter Csathy</a> wrote a fairly <a href="http://digitalmediaupdate.blogspot.com/2010/09/think-h264-is-now-royalty-free-think.html">detailed post</a> on the matter, pointing out some key details that many in the media skipped. Here&#8217;s the core of what wasn&#8217;t discussed after the MPEG LA announcement (but should have been):</p>

<p><em>But, you say, MPEG LA recently announced that it will no longer charge royalties for the use of H.264. Yes, it’s true – MPEG LA recently bowed to mounting pressure from, and press surrounding, WebM and announced something that kind of sounds that way. But, I caution you to read the not-too-fine print. H.264 is royalty-free only in one limited case – for Internet video that is delivered free to end users. Read again: <strong><strong>for (1) Internet delivery that is (2) delivered free to end users</strong></strong>. In the words of MPEG LA’s own press release, “Products and services other than [those] continue to be royalty-bearing.”</em></p>

<p><a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s VP of Engineering offer&#8217;s a somewhat similar take in &#8221;<a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/08/27/free-as-in-smokescreen/">Free as in Smokescreen</a>:&#8221;</p>

<p><em>What MPEG-LA announced is that their current moratorium on charging fees for the <strong>transmission of H.264 content</strong>, previously extended through 2015 for uses that don’t charge users, is now permanent. You still have to pay for a license for H.264 if you want to make things that create it, consume it, or your business model for distributing it is direct rather than indirect.</em></p>

<p><em>What they’ve made permanently free is distribution of content that people have already licensed to encode, and will need a license to decode. This is similar to Nikon announcing that they will not charge you if you put your pictures up on Flickr, or HP promising that they will never charge you additionally if you photocopy something that you printed on a LaserJet.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for one of the licensors to reinterpret the license and claim that ads constitute a form of payment or some similar excuse to exclude them from the exception they granted. I&#8217;ve yet to get my hands on the latest licensing agreement to see exactly what it says about this, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to see this card played at some point to wring extra revenue from these patents.</p>

<p>Given that Google owns the massive video sharing site YouTube, which <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html">uses H.264</a>, plus whatever unknown projects relating to <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> - it stands to reason that Google would certainly save some money by moving away from such an encumbered technology; not to mention avoid future risk should rules change. Though personally, I also have to wonder if it could be fears of a repeat of the <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/archives/">GIF patent</a> debacle.</p>

<p><strong>Now where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>Right now HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> is a mess, at best. There is a war for which codec becomes the de facto standard, and there is a <em>lot</em> of money at stake depending on who wins. At this point there is no single codec that works across all major browsers; to get full coverage the best option now looks to be a combination of H.264, WebM, and Flash. Doesn&#8217;t really sound like the progress that was promised with HTML5 does it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting though that Google isn&#8217;t the first browser developer to reject H.264; both <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/01/23/html5-video-and-codecs/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/12/31/re-introducing-video">Opera</a> have decided against including it in their browsers as well. As painful as the fragmentation is now in regard to who supports what, this move by Google actually does little to change the landscape. Support has been fragmented from the beginning, and all this really does it push H.264 a step away from being the de facto standard; a title that it has been very close to seizing.</p>

<p>Had Firefox added support for H.264, I think the fight would be over and would have made today&#8217;s announcement almost suicidal for the project. Though with such a major player holding out against it, Google&#8217;s move becomes a minor tactical shift in the short-term (though the long-term impact could be significant).</p>

<p>I could go on for pages about what works are where we are now, but <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> (an infinitely better writer than I) sums it all up here: &#8221;<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#what-works">Dive into HTML5: Video on the Web</a>&#8221; - well worth reading if you want to really understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>So in summary - video needs to be encoded to multiple formats, which today&#8217;s announcement does little to alter due to the fragmentation that was already in place. In the long run, WebM may be better for the community due to its license, though many of the internet&#8217;s biggest players have a vested interest in H.264. So when you factor in politics and propaganda between competing companies, distrust, and possible patent claims that haven&#8217;t been addressed yet; this all leads me to an even simpler summary:</p>

<p>Yesterday, HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> was a mess; tomorrow it will still be a mess.</p>

<time datetime="2011-01-02T17:34:07-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 2<span>nd</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I get started, let me make a couple of things clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple is evil; pure and simple. I&#8217;m fully convinced that Steve Jobs has weekly planning meetings with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> himself1.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s policies are anti-everybody. From bloggers to developers2, Apple seems to make life as hard as possible for those that use their products for profit.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With these facts in mind, I tend to shy away from their products when I have a choice (which isn&#8217;t always <a href="http://shadowofthebat.com/2010/12/05/buying-a-macbook-from-cowboom-com/">the case</a>); though a while back I decided to buy an iPad for some reason. I&#8217;ve wanted a tablet for quite some time, and despite my hopes of there being a Microsoft-based solution that would do what I needed, there wasn&#8217;t anything announced that had the features I wanted in a price range that I could justify.</p>

<p>When I first powered it up and was met by that familiar instruction to connect to iTunes, I was really questioning the wisdom of buying an Apple product. But, I took a deep breath, installed iTunes and took the plunge.</p>

<p>That was about 3 months ago, and I no longer question the wisdom – it was a great purchase, and has become a key part of how I work. Between my favorite applications (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a>, and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a>), I&#8217;ve been able to streamline my workflow, keep better notes, and keep the information that I need available – no matter when or where I need it.</p>

<p>The device itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology">ingeniously</a>) designed, with Apple&#8217;s typical focus on simplicity first and foremost. It has a ~10-hour battery life ensures that you&#8217;ll make it through the work day (and probably with enough left to do some reading after work); though your PC probably won&#8217;t be able to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060">charge it</a>. The only thing missing from a hardware perspective is a &#8216;back&#8217; button, as I would quite likely use that more than the &#8216;home&#8217; button.</p>

<p>I was quite concerned initially that it would be like so many other devices and gadgets that I&#8217;ve acquired other the years, interesting for a couple of weeks then doomed to spend the rest of its life buried in one of my &#8216;junk&#8217; boxes. Within the first few hours I was sure that wouldn&#8217;t be its fate; far from it. At this point I rarely leave home without it, even if only going shopping. While I do still rely on my Moto DROID for a number of things, I&#8217;ve found that the iPad does a much better job at serving most of the roles my phone was once responsible for.</p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> – it&#8217;s by far my favorite service and I access it from every device I have. Prior to the iPad I often took notes on the DROID to avoid having to use hand-written notes that would need to be transcribed later; thanks to its small screen and tiny keyboard my notes were as terse as I could get them, often missing details I later wished I had. With the large screen and large, better designed keyboard of the iPad, I&#8217;ve found my notes are now clearer and more detailed – exactly what I need them to be.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who bought one shortly after they came out referred to it as a media consumption device, not suited for work or anything serious. While this is what I expected, it&#8217;s not what I found; it&#8217;s a great media player (despite the lack of a 16:9 screen) and thanks to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8">Kindle</a> application, it&#8217;s also a very good e-reader, but with the right applications it has a strong business side as well.</p>

<p>What I feared would be a toy relegated to the abyss of abandoned gadgets has turned into a key tool helping me keep my chaotic life in order.</p>

<p>1Before anybody says anything, yes, this is just a joke.
2While Apple has made a lot of <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/09/apple-opens-app-store-to-other-development-platforms-publishes-review-guidelines/">progress</a> in opening up and making rules more clear, though they could still do better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had a great idea; a trip down to Florida to visit family and celebrate our second anniversary - the idea turned out to be a bit less great than I had hoped. Of the seven days we were there, on three the wind-chill was less than 40F. On the upside, I had booked a room at a newer (opened in 2006) 4-star hotel; if we&#8217;re going to be stuck inside, no reason not to be in a great room.</p>

<p>The hotel was <a href="http://www.rosenshinglecreek.com/">Rosen Shingle Creek</a>, a rather large (1,500 rooms plus a 450,000 sq. ft. conference area) and quite impressive facility. The view as you drive up to the main entrance is most impressive; 14-stories tall and inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Revival_architecture">Spanish Colonial Revival</a> architecture that was so popular in Florida during the early 1900s. As you approach the hotel, you&#8217;ll notice that the driveway is offset to the left to enhance the initial impression.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26686573@N00/4693535920/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4693535920_4e031719ea.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The rooms are well-appointed, and well designed. The use of art by a local photographer (which is featured throughout the hotel) seems, to me at least, far better than the random paintings and abstract art I&#8217;ve seen at most other hotels I&#8217;ve been to recently. As would be expected from a 4-star hotel, the beds are comfortable; though personally I believe that the beds at the nearby <a href="http://www.renaissanceseaworldorlando.com/">Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld</a> are far superior.</p>

<p>The hotel&#8217;s public spaces are nearly as impressive as its exterior appearance, with abundant marble and stonework, and large open spaces. It is certainly an upscale hotel, and you are reminded of that fact each and every step of the way.</p>

<p>Though with this praise, there are a few things I really didn&#8217;t care for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parking: Valet parking is a steep $20/day; there is the option to self-park for $12/day, but in the evening the parking lot fills quickly. If the thought of walking close to a half-mile at the end of a long day walking around theme parks seems like a bad idea, then I would avoid the self-parking.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet: The lack of in-room Wi-Fi is (in my opinion) inexcusable for such a new hotel. Between my wife and me, there were three laptops and two iPads; so a single wired internet connection just doesn&#8217;t cut it. I don&#8217;t mind paying the $13/day they change for internet access (well, I do mind, but there&#8217;s little choice but to live with it), but I need to be able to use it the way I want to use it. In a world where more and more devices come with Wi-Fi built-in, there&#8217;s no reason for any hotel to not provide in-room Wi-Fi access.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning: The room was nearly spotless when we arrived (and what little was missed was quite excusable), and the daily cleaning was always courteous and thorough. Some other areas though, didn&#8217;t receive the same level of attention. For example, the in the hallway leading to our room there were scraps of paper and other debris on the floor for almost the entire time we were there. Not a huge deal, but if they only vacuum the hallway once a week – what else are they not doing right?</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: I don&#8217;t mind tipping for good service (and I tend to be more generous than most), but I can&#8217;t stand people who demand tips. I&#8217;ve not seen people push for tips like that in a long time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a nice hotel and I wouldn&#8217;t suggest avoiding it; though there are better hotels in the area.</p>
