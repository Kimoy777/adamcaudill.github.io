  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoy what I do, and though I work in a chaotic environment, I really do love my job. Being in the Software Development industry has some really nice perks, being a developer in today&#8217;s world really is a great thing. Development isn&#8217;t easy though, it is quite mentally demanding; clear focus is of paramount importance. Without absolute focus, progress will only be a dream. This fact is a key player as to what makes being in this industry so great.</p>

<p>That is, if you aren&#8217;t a monkey.</p>

<p>In the time I&#8217;ve spent so far at my current company, I&#8217;ve come to understand just how clear the separation is of the two primary developer types. From all of my previous contracting work, I believed that the differences between the two sides of the fence were minimal. Wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The Fence </strong></p>

<p>There are, fundamentally, two types of developers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monkeys - Developers that work as part of the IT department of a larger company.These developers create software primarily for internal use.</p></li>
<li><p>Superstars - Developers that build software that primarily used externally.These developers typically write software that is sold commercially.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These two groups form the basis of the industry, and how the two are treated. While one could say that &#8220;a developer is a developer, right?&#8221; - That is not only quite wrong, it&#8217;s sadly misinformed. The line between the two is quite clear, at to me, clearer than ever.</p>

<p><strong>The Difference </strong></p>

<p>The difference between the two largely comes down to how they are treated, and the respect they receive. There is an entire list of small differences, here&#8217;s a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Interruptions - Our monkeys tend to receive far more interruptions, providing a constant source of distractions. This causes the developer to achieve less productivity, and thus incur more pressure. The pressure typically comes in the form of increased distractions due to projects being late.</p></li>
<li><p>Creature Comforts - The superstars normally see more perks to make their life better, be it the very nice though oddly-shaped <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/aeron/">Aeron</a> chair (at a mere $900 each), or a retired <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/03/36322071_9b4f668819_o.jpg">airplane wing</a> - just to spruce up the place. That&#8217;s not to mention simple things like higher end PCs, or decent desks. These are things that our monkeys often have to learn to live without, as the budget is far too tight to allow the extra spending.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities - The monkeys in the industry often have far more projects that they own. This helps to contribute to the increases distractions, as well as further removing the ability to stay focused on a single task. With a dozen or more projects under a single developers ownership, the day-to-day issues of managing them all can be overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom - Superstars are often given a fair bit more freedom, both in what they work on, and in exploring new methods and technologies. This not only adds value for the company by staying on the cutting edge, but also for the developer. By staying on the cutting edge, it increases their marketability.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few simple examples, there are many, many more.</p>

<p><strong>The Reason</strong></p>

<p>This is a complex yet simple question. The same applies to the answer, simple in that it can be summed up in 3 letters, yet complex in its ramifications. The answer: ROI.</p>

<p>One of the most basic business metrics, Return on Investment, this is the key to how many managers see the world. With superstars this is an easily defined number; simply compare your net projects to what you are paying the developers for that project. While that won&#8217;t give you a complete picture due to other costs involved (such as marketing &amp; support), it does give you a starting point.</p>

<p>The picture with the monkeys is quite different in that there doesn&#8217;t exist a clear way to establish ROI for a developer, when there is no profit connected to their work. While we could use estimates, such as the cost of hiring a consultant, though that would be highly inaccurate, and is thus mostly ignored.</p>

<p>This is the issue, if management can&#8217;t place a dollar value on the development work currently underway, they simply will not see any business value in giving the developers what they need. It&#8217;s just that simple.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>I honestly wish there was an answer here, but there isn&#8217;t. Management doesn&#8217;t seem to grasp the importance of internal development in many companies, and I can&#8217;t say I see a change coming. This requires upper-level management to change their mindset when it comes to the nature of creating software, and IT in general.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s simple to sit here and explain what&#8217;s different and why, thinking of a way of leveling the playing field far less so. I&#8217;ve spent a fair bit of time trying to think of an answer, so far the only one that&#8217;s occurred to me is to either move to the other side of the fence, or become a consultant.</p>

<p><strong>The Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This article, in its first draft, also included a few addition personal details that did add to the motivation to write this. Among these, were the details of the computer that I was given when I started my current job. The system was a small Dell PC, 1.3GHz, 256MB RAM, and to complete the package, a 15-inch monitor. There were quite a few other, similarly annoying, details as well. Thankfully, at least some of these have improved (still far from what <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/05/02.html">FogCreek</a> offers though); I&#8217;ve opted to remove that section in the interest of fairness.</p>

<p>Originally, I had intended this to be more of a scathing look at working as a monkey, this was changed in hopes of finding a middle ground, so that hopefully this article will generate some useful feedback on the problem, and how best to address it. I would appreciate any constructive comments on this, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if there are any possible solutions (well, I&#8217;ll be happy with a step in the right direction).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visual Basic is at an interesting crossroads, it&#8217;s at a critical juncture between two paths. One path, it has followed since its earliest days, where simplicity and ease of use ruled over maintainability and solid design. The other, the longer, harder road, is that of design over ease. With the release of Visual Basic .NET, a major shift occurred in the direction the language is taking, though looking back now, nearly 5 years later, I&#8217;m finding myself concerned for the future of the language.</p>

<p>Before I go much further, let me give you some background so that you can have a clearer understanding of my perspective. I&#8217;m a VB developer, I work exclusively in Visual Basic, and quite honestly I do love the language. It&#8217;s productivity at it&#8217;s best. I started using VB5 and at some point, I&#8217;ve used every version since then. So while I will be saying some negative things about VB, this isn&#8217;t bashing the language, this is me trying to open people&#8217;s eyes to the state of a great language.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>The issues VB as a language is facing is the desire from Microsoft to keep long-time users around, while trying to advance the language. Instead of making a clean break, they are falling into the trap they fell into with Internet Explorer, where they continued to build on broken code, to ensure that thing would work the same way (the IE team is trying to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">get out of the hole</a>). This has resulted in a language that makes heavy use of crutches to prevent pre-.NET users from having to re-learn their language.</p>

<p>While backwards compatibility is a nice thing to offer, when you are making major changes to a language, sometimes it&#8217;s best to start over and break the mistakes of the past. I understood the forces at play when .NET was originally released, so it&#8217;s understandable that Microsoft would choose to add crutches to make the transition easier. All of 5 years and two versions latter, the picture doesn&#8217;t look any better.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the crutches included in .NET 1.0 &amp; Visual Basic 2002 were temporary and would fade out as new versions are released. Nope. Instead of removing this legacy support, they continue to add more as the marketing forces inside Microsoft push to get the remaining pre-.NET VB developers to migrate. This is the same thing that was being done with Internet Explorer, which when the next version, 7, is released, it will cause many web sites to either display improperly, or not function at all. They are breaking it to fix it, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll need to get to the same point with VB before it continues down the proper path.</p>

<p>As compatibility is continuously made a priority over good design, VB will continue to slip, and continue to carry the reputation the mistakes of the past gave it.</p>

<p>C# was created with a true, very logical OOP model, VB was developed with a concoction of the C# &amp; VB6 models, which is enforced by both the compiler and the Visual Studio IDE. These are not simply issues with the use of legacy methods, but the very model that the language is based on.</p>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s To Blame</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft, of course.. right? Wrong.</p>

<p>The problem lies with the developers that use VB, not those that develop it. The primary issue I see is that legacy developers are not investing in the training or education to use VB properly. They continue to use antiquated methods and models they learned from VB6 and its predecessors.  The issue is that they create a hybrid type of code, that doesn&#8217;t follow a logical OOP model, instead following the pseudo-OOP model processed by VB6.</p>

<p>VB.NET has the potential to be a truly great language, the main issue is its habit of thinking for the developer, C# was developed without the mistakes of prior languages, and has so far done very well as it can take full advantage of the .NET Framework. VB on the other hand is somewhat limited in that due to trying to partially emulate the object model and structure of its predecessor, it loses flexibility granted to the other .NET languages.</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it</strong></p>

<p>Great question.</p>

<p>The only answer I see is to stop using legacy functionality, and calls for Microsoft to clean up the model used. When writing code in VB or C#, the IDE &amp; compilers should produce virtually identical code. As it stands now, there is a significant difference in the code the compiler generates, the assumptions it makes (many of which can <em>not</em> be over-ridden).</p>

<p>Until developers stand up, and take responsibility for using the language in the way it should be, I doubt we&#8217;ll see any progress. We can hope things will change, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath. (Though, as a side note, C# is looking more appealing every day.)</p>

by Simon Robinson</p>

<p>This is a book I picked on clearance at the local Books-A-Million, being targeted at the 1.0 release of the Framework I was aware it was rather dated, though it was still a decent looking book (and it was cheap). The author doesn&#8217;t jest when he uses the word <em>advanced</em>, this is an in-depth book.</p>

<p>While I tend to be forgiving of small typos in books, this book has an unforgivable number of errors. While much of the content is useful (and seems correct), there are enough editing issues to make me second-guess <em>everything</em>. With as many errors as I saw, I was almost wondering if was a test printing of the manuscript, though after some checking, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. This book had the potential to be one of my favorites due to the way the author explains topics, and the vast amount of hard to find information included.</p>

<p>Yet, it leaves me disappointed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to say that this is a book everyone should read, but due to countless editing errors, all this one is - is a &#8216;could have&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The price of storage has been steadily dropping over the last several years, and this is the latest example: <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=183702383">A Complete Terabyte File Server For About $500</a>  - Yep, you read that right, a custom 1TB file server, in the $500 range. While I&#8217;m not sure what I could do with that much storage (I remember saying that when I picked a 1.25GB drive over a 1.5GB, saying I&#8217;d never need it), but it&#8217;d be nice to have. :)</p>

<p>On the topic of cheap storage, I just purchased a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822144701">250GB SATA</a>  drive to replace my 80GB data drive that&#8217;s almost full. With SATA drives under $100 for 250GB, I&#8217;m tempted to try my own version of his project.</p>
