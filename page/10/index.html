  <div class="entry-content"><p>Huge PGP files, an ancient version of PGP, and errors every time they tried to decrypt a file - that was my completely unexpected challenge on Friday. Dealing with file processing issues really isn&#8217;t part of my job description, but I&#8217;m the closest thing my company has to an expert when it comes to encryption, so the task fell to me.</p>

<p>After looking at the options and issues to get the server upgraded to a non-stone-age version of the PGP software, the easiest answer looked like decrypting the files with GPG - it wasn&#8217;t as easy as expected, but I did get some useful information that may help others.</p>

<h3>IDEA</h3>

<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm">IDEA</a> this would have been easy, but the keys used for this transfer were old (thankfully the data isn&#8217;t sensitive) and IDEA it was. GPG <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/faq/why-not-idea.en.html">doesn&#8217;t support IDEA</a> due to various patents (most if not all of which are now expired), so that leaves us to use a rather old plug-in to fill in the gap. Unfortunately for me, the server that hosts up that plug-in is misconfigured, making it impossible to retrieve the file.</p>

<p>Thankfully there are <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/gpg-idea.htm">other sources</a> (<a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/ideadll.zip">mirror</a>).</p>

<h3>Gpg4win</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> so I could decrypt the files from Windows - which had unexpected consequences. The current version of Gpg4win uses gpg version 2.0, which isn&#8217;t compatible with the IDEA plug-in - a fact that isn&#8217;t pointed out anywhere.</p>

<p>The key to making this work was to use an older version of Gpg4win - I used <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">v1.1.4</a>, which thankfully is compatible with the plug-in. Though I do wish I found this out a few hours sooner than I did.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The setup for this is pretty simple, it&#8217;s documented in a few places, but here is a quick wrap-up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">Gpg4win v1.1.4</a></li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, and copy to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib</code></li>
<li><p>Update (or create if itâ€™s not there) the <code>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\gpg.conf</code> file to include the following:</p>

<p> <code>load-extension "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib\idea.dll"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once this is done, you can run <code>gpg --version</code> which will give you information about what algorithms are supported. It should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9 (Gpg4win 1.1.4)
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Home: C:/Users/Adam/AppData/Roaming/gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
</code></pre>

<p>If you note the first item on the &#8220;Cipher&#8221; line is IDEA, that means it worked. If you don&#8217;t see that - something went wrong, probably a bad path.</p>

<p>This version is able to handle the large files that old versions of PGP can&#8217;t, and it allowed for a quick solution to the problem until we can upgrade the server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While preparing to deploy an internal application I started to wonder if all of the workstations were properly configured - after a quick search I found a number of methods for detecting the .NET framework locally, but I didn&#8217;t find any clean options that worked remotely.</p>

<p>Thankfully I found a post with a few <a href="http://skatterbrainz.blogspot.com/2011/05/assorted-ways-to-detect-net-40.html">detection methods</a>, one of which was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI</a> from VBScript - which gave me the inspiration I needed:</p>

<p>I pulled up <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> and whipped up a quick script to check for both the Client Profile and full (extended) version on a list of computers. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be of some use others.</p>

<time datetime="2012-05-02T14:08:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 2<span>nd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It wasn&#8217;t long after Google went live that they became my search engine of choice - with the only other (somewhat) viable option being Yahoo, it was an easy choice. In the years since then, I&#8217;ve not questioned that choice, but now that Google is focusing on killing features and building little-used social features, the time seemed right to see if there are better options.</p>

<p>So a month ago I began an experiment, I committed to using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for a month - here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<p><em>Quality:</em> The quality of the results is at par with Google for the vast majority of queries. On some queries where there are few results, Google tends to rank the results more accurately.</p>

<p><em>Index Size:</em> The Google index seems to be larger, with faster additions than DuckDuckGo, though this was only a real issue for very obscure search terms. For the majority of queries, this isn&#8217;t noticeable.</p>

<p><em>Bang Syntax:</em> DuckDuckGo has a great feature called &#8217;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">!bang</a>&#8217; which allows you to search specific sites easily. Of all the options here are the ones I used most often:</p>

<ul>
<li>!amazon - Search Amazon.com</li>
<li>!g - Google Search</li>
<li>!man Search the *nix man pages</li>
</ul>


<p>The bang syntax works great with the Search/Address bar in Chrome, making this my favorite feature.</p>

<p><em>Speed:</em> DuckDuckGo feels much faster that Google does now (which is sad, as Google used to be amazingly fast, even on extremely slow connections), and the results page is clean and free of useless distractions.</p>

<p><em>Image Search:</em> One that DuckDuckGo is missing compared to Google is a useful image search feature. Though you can easily jump to Google&#8217;s image search by adding &#8220;!i&#8221; to your query.</p>

<p><em>Zero Click Info:</em> For a number of searches, DuckDuckGo displays an answer from an authoritative source, often giving you what you need to know without having to go any further. For me, the most useful of these is data from StackOverflow and Wikipedia.</p>

<p><em>Auto-Complete / Suggestions:</em> This is the single biggest thing I&#8217;ve missed, it seems like a minor feature but I didn&#8217;t realize how useful it was until is wasn&#8217;t available. Hopefully they&#8217;ll add this at some point, would be a real step in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> I&#8217;m impressed. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s far more competitive than I expected. It&#8217;s clean, lean, and <a href="http://donttrack.us/">private</a>. Over the last month I&#8217;ve still used other Google services and products (Chrome, Gmail, Google Voice, Google Authenticator, etc.) so it wasn&#8217;t a complete separation from Google - but enough to remind me that innovation is still happening elsewhere.</p>

<p>As Google has shifted much of its energy from information to social, companies like DuckDuckGo are continuing to innovate and find better ways to provide the information that we live on.</p>

For PasteBin, it&#8217;s easy to see why their policy changed - currently they can&#8217;t deny knowledge of what they are hosting, it&#8217;s plain-text and easily scanned (look <a href="http://www.leakedin.com/">at this</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me). ZeroBin on the other hand has taken a very different approach - to not just have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a>, but absolute deniability.</p>

<p>The key to this is that ZeroBin stores pastes and discussions encrypted - and the encryption is performed in the browser, with a browser generated key. This means that the people running the ZeroBin software have no knowledge of what they are storing.</p>

<p>So, if they are asked to remove content, all they can do is remove specific named items - it would be impossible to remove all items that contain specific material (where if PasteBin was to be ordered to remove all items containing credit card numbers, it&#8217;s a realistic possibility). As long as knowledge of the key remains limited - the paste will likely live on, no matter the content.</p>

<p>To make it even better, there are no accounts - so there&#8217;s no way to see what a specific user is posting. With a properly configured server, this could be completely anonymous. With no knowledge of the content, no knowledge of users - it&#8217;s the ultimate in deniability.</p>

<p>I really expect that this technique will become far more common in the future. It allows a much higher level of deniability for hosts and service provider, and greatly restricts the ability of investigators to research the activities of a user or group.</p>

<p>Take a closer look at this, I expect you&#8217;ll see more of this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Intel and various industry partners started talking about &#8220;ultra-books&#8221; as competition against Apple and tablets, I was more than a little skeptical. Ultra-books are small and light weight - but not cheap (average price being around $1,000) and rather underpowered compared to what you can get for the same money with a more traditional laptop (they are basically MacBook Air knock-offs). I had written them off almost as soon as they were announced.</p>

<p>I really expected the ultra-book to be a fad, and a short-lived one at that.</p>

<p>Then came the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OEL86Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcaucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006OEL86Q">HP Folio 13</a> - my desktop recently failed, and since then I&#8217;ve been using my 2+ year old ASUS G73 as my only machine. While the G73 is great - it&#8217;s also massive, hot, and heavy. After parting with my unused camera gear, I acquired a Folio 13 to act as my main laptop, leaving the G73 to play the role of desktop / development machine.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours of getting the Folio 13 it was clear, I was in love.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not quite the love I felt when I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2011/01/02/thoughts-on-the-ipad-from-an-apple-hater/">first found the iPad</a>, but it&#8217;s an amazing machine. Fast, super-light, and the battery goes on forever - it&#8217;s the ideal laptop. With the power of my G73 available anytime via RDP, I think this combination is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a rough overview of the Folio:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel Core i3 / i5**</li>
<li>128GB SSD</li>
<li>4GB RAM</li>
<li>13.3&#8221; 1366x768 display</li>
<li>9 hour battery (so far 7-8 hours seems to be the realistic number)</li>
<li>Brushed aluminum case</li>
<li>3.3lbs</li>
</ul>


<p>Also included are the normal things you would expect, like a web cam, Bluetooth, etc..</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed with what this little thing can do, from large compiles to generating <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> sites, it&#8217;s more capable than I expected. So far it&#8217;s handled everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it - and most taking around the same time as my G73 would (and some taking less, thanks to the Folio&#8217;s SSD).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be doing most of my writing and non-development work on the Folio, and the G73 will still be my go-to system anytime I need Visual Studio or other heavy-weight development tools (though I&#8217;d be willing to bet, it&#8217;ll be via RDP from the Folio more often than not).</p>

<p>Overall: I&#8217;m extremely pleased. It&#8217;s a great device - it has the battery life and portability of a tablet (i.e. an iPad), with the power and flexibility of a traditional laptop.</p>

<p>** The Core i3 version is less expense, and thanks to the lower power consumption, it also stretches the battery life better than the i5 - making it a win-win.</p>
