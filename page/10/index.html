  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> LastPass has confirmed that they&#8217;ll address this issue in the next release.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> LastPass has addressed this issue in their new v2.0 release. There is still a way to bypass the password prompt in Chrome, but they will address that in the next release. Overall, it looks like we can close the books on this one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> - it&#8217;s a great service that has impressed me every step of the way. Though it&#8217;s not perfect, and I&#8217;ve found a small hole that makes it easier for an attacker to get your passwords - if the following are true:</p>

<ol>
<li>The attacker has physical access to your PC.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve made the mistake of not locking your PC when you walk away.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve select the option to stay logged on - which happens to be a default, or, you&#8217;ve left your browser open (as I expect most people do).</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/lastpass_default_opt.png"></p>

<p>If all three of these are true (or your PC is otherwise compromised) - you probably shouldn&#8217;t expect much in the way of security, but LastPass does protect you - most of the time. If you try to copy or view a password, you&#8217;ll be prompted to enter your Master Password - but there&#8217;s one case that can easily expose your passwords without needing to know the Master Password.</p>

<p>The issue is that LastPass allows you to change the address associated with a login without confirming your master password. This would allow an attacker to update an entry in your vault to a specially crafted page to echo the password - allowing the attacker to see the password and leave minimal tracks behind. I setup a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/EchoLoginForm.html">special page</a> to test this, it echoes the password as soon as LastPass enters it, allowing me to see the password in a few seconds without providing the master password (it&#8217;s also possible to update the password without providing the Master Password, providing another opportunity for mischief).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/lastpass_edit.png"></p>

<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve not taken the time to build a tool to automate this - it would be a fairly simple process to do, just a matter of investing the time (which unfortunately I don&#8217;t have). The obvious solution would be to automate the GUI interaction to perform the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the URL to a malicious page.</li>
<li>Navigate to the page, and log the login data.</li>
<li>Revert the URL to the original value.</li>
</ul>


<p>Using this method it would be possible to collect all of a users credentials within just a few minutes. It&#8217;s possible there may be a simpler &amp; faster route available by interacting directly with the plug-ins, though in looking at the exports and COM interfaces I didn&#8217;t see an obvious way to achieve this (which as a LastPass user, this makes me happy).</p>

<p>For an attacker, one substantial upside is that there would be little evidence of the event - while the LastPass Vault will show that all entries have been &#8220;touched&#8221; recently, I would venture to say that very few users would actually notice.</p>

<p>While this attack requires full access as the logged-in user, if a PC is otherwise compromised (perhaps as part of an APT type attack), it could allow an attacker to greatly expand their activities with a minimal time investment. This is the type of situation that could take a fairly small local information disclosure and turn it into a real nightmare scenario for a targeted user.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>The simplest solution for this issue is to require Master Password verification if the URL changes, or at least require it if the domain changes. This should be a minor change for them and will eliminate this attack vector. Thankfully this is a minor issue, due to the three requirements required to pull this off - so I don&#8217;t believe there is too much risk due to this oversight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently finished building my first <a href="http://minipwner.com/">MiniPwner</a> - a tiny <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>-based system for pen-testing. At only 2.25 x 2.25 inches, the device plus battery is still extremely small - it easily fits in a pocket, and could be hidden anywhere.</p>

<p>The device is based on the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">TP-LINK TL-WR703N</a>, which uses a 400Mhz Atheros AR7240 CPU - not exactly a power-house, but enough power for standard pen-testing (or even just as a super-portable linux box). In cases where the 400Mhz CPU and 32MB RAM aren&#8217;t enough, you can easily use OpenVPN as a tunnel to run your tests remotely.</p>

<p>The total investment for the build was only $38 - though next time I&#8217;ll pay a little extra and get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FYNSZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcaucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005FYNSZA">16GB drive</a> - mostly for extra room when working with logs. The 4GB drive used in the standard build has plenty of room for the software - but I&#8217;d rather have the extra room to work with.</p>

<p>The build process was process was simple - thankfully the <a href="http://minipwner.com/index.php/minipwner-build">instructions</a> are quite good, though I did have to change a few things to make it all work.</p>

<p>Step 1): To save looking, <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">here&#8217;s</a> a direct link to the OpenWrt image.</p>

<p>Step 4): I formated the thumb drive by mounting it in a Ubuntu VM, and used <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted</a> to delete the existing partition, and created a 512MB swap partition, then the rest is ext4.</p>

<p>Step 16): Read step 17 first so you don&#8217;t feel so stupid for wasting time trying to figure out why step 16 doesn&#8217;t seem to do anything.</p>

<p>Step 21): I use WPA2 on my network, so I had to edit the <code>/etc/config/wireless</code> a little differently:</p>

<pre><code>config wifi-iface
        option device   wlan0
        option network  wan
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     &lt;ssid&gt;
        option encryption psk2+tkip
        option key &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>More information about the wireless setup can be found <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">here</a>.</p>

<p>Step 24): My local wireless network is in the 192.168.1.x range, so this wasn&#8217;t working for me. Seeing as changing the wireless doesn&#8217;t make sense for me (way too many static devices), I had to change the IP address of <code>eth0</code> to deal with the issue. I updated my <code>/etc/config/network</code> to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>config 'interface' 'lan'
        option 'ifname' 'eth0'
        option 'type' 'bridge'
        option 'proto' 'static'
        option 'ipaddr' '192.168.2.1'
        option 'netmask' '255.255.255.0'
</code></pre>

<p>Once the change is made, you&#8217;ll need to execute <code>/etc/init.d/network restart</code> - then update your PC&#8217;s static IP address to &#8220;192.168.2.111&#8221; and reconnect your telnet session.</p>

<p>Step 27): When executing the installs I was receiving this error:</p>

<pre><code>opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package &lt;package-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To correct this error, I had to run <code>opkg update</code> - after this the installs started working fine.</p>

<p>Step 27b): The install for <code>samba2-client</code> was failing, as there isn&#8217;t a package by that name - though <code>samba36-client</code> installed fine.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a great little setup - I&#8217;m quite pleased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Huge PGP files, an ancient version of PGP, and errors every time they tried to decrypt a file - that was my completely unexpected challenge on Friday. Dealing with file processing issues really isn&#8217;t part of my job description, but I&#8217;m the closest thing my company has to an expert when it comes to encryption, so the task fell to me.</p>

<p>After looking at the options and issues to get the server upgraded to a non-stone-age version of the PGP software, the easiest answer looked like decrypting the files with GPG - it wasn&#8217;t as easy as expected, but I did get some useful information that may help others.</p>

<h3>IDEA</h3>

<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm">IDEA</a> this would have been easy, but the keys used for this transfer were old (thankfully the data isn&#8217;t sensitive) and IDEA it was. GPG <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/faq/why-not-idea.en.html">doesn&#8217;t support IDEA</a> due to various patents (most if not all of which are now expired), so that leaves us to use a rather old plug-in to fill in the gap. Unfortunately for me, the server that hosts up that plug-in is misconfigured, making it impossible to retrieve the file.</p>

<p>Thankfully there are <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/gpg-idea.htm">other sources</a> (<a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/ideadll.zip">mirror</a>).</p>

<h3>Gpg4win</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> so I could decrypt the files from Windows - which had unexpected consequences. The current version of Gpg4win uses gpg version 2.0, which isn&#8217;t compatible with the IDEA plug-in - a fact that isn&#8217;t pointed out anywhere.</p>

<p>The key to making this work was to use an older version of Gpg4win - I used <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">v1.1.4</a>, which thankfully is compatible with the plug-in. Though I do wish I found this out a few hours sooner than I did.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The setup for this is pretty simple, it&#8217;s documented in a few places, but here is a quick wrap-up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">Gpg4win v1.1.4</a></li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, and copy to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib</code></li>
<li><p>Update (or create if it’s not there) the <code>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\gpg.conf</code> file to include the following:</p>

<p> <code>load-extension "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib\idea.dll"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once this is done, you can run <code>gpg --version</code> which will give you information about what algorithms are supported. It should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9 (Gpg4win 1.1.4)
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;

Home: C:/Users/Adam/AppData/Roaming/gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
</code></pre>

<p>If you note the first item on the &#8220;Cipher&#8221; line is IDEA, that means it worked. If you don&#8217;t see that - something went wrong, probably a bad path.</p>

<p>This version is able to handle the large files that old versions of PGP can&#8217;t, and it allowed for a quick solution to the problem until we can upgrade the server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While preparing to deploy an internal application I started to wonder if all of the workstations were properly configured - after a quick search I found a number of methods for detecting the .NET framework locally, but I didn&#8217;t find any clean options that worked remotely.</p>

<p>Thankfully I found a post with a few <a href="http://skatterbrainz.blogspot.com/2011/05/assorted-ways-to-detect-net-40.html">detection methods</a>, one of which was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI</a> from VBScript - which gave me the inspiration I needed:</p>

<p>I pulled up <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> and whipped up a quick script to check for both the Client Profile and full (extended) version on a list of computers. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be of some use others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It wasn&#8217;t long after Google went live that they became my search engine of choice - with the only other (somewhat) viable option being Yahoo, it was an easy choice. In the years since then, I&#8217;ve not questioned that choice, but now that Google is focusing on killing features and building little-used social features, the time seemed right to see if there are better options.</p>

<p>So a month ago I began an experiment, I committed to using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for a month - here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<p><em>Quality:</em> The quality of the results is at par with Google for the vast majority of queries. On some queries where there are few results, Google tends to rank the results more accurately.</p>

<p><em>Index Size:</em> The Google index seems to be larger, with faster additions than DuckDuckGo, though this was only a real issue for very obscure search terms. For the majority of queries, this isn&#8217;t noticeable.</p>

<p><em>Bang Syntax:</em> DuckDuckGo has a great feature called &#8217;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">!bang</a>&#8217; which allows you to search specific sites easily. Of all the options here are the ones I used most often:</p>

<ul>
<li>!amazon - Search Amazon.com</li>
<li>!g - Google Search</li>
<li>!man Search the *nix man pages</li>
</ul>


<p>The bang syntax works great with the Search/Address bar in Chrome, making this my favorite feature.</p>

<p><em>Speed:</em> DuckDuckGo feels much faster that Google does now (which is sad, as Google used to be amazingly fast, even on extremely slow connections), and the results page is clean and free of useless distractions.</p>

<p><em>Image Search:</em> One that DuckDuckGo is missing compared to Google is a useful image search feature. Though you can easily jump to Google&#8217;s image search by adding &#8220;!i&#8221; to your query.</p>

<p><em>Zero Click Info:</em> For a number of searches, DuckDuckGo displays an answer from an authoritative source, often giving you what you need to know without having to go any further. For me, the most useful of these is data from StackOverflow and Wikipedia.</p>

<p><em>Auto-Complete / Suggestions:</em> This is the single biggest thing I&#8217;ve missed, it seems like a minor feature but I didn&#8217;t realize how useful it was until is wasn&#8217;t available. Hopefully they&#8217;ll add this at some point, would be a real step in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> I&#8217;m impressed. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s far more competitive than I expected. It&#8217;s clean, lean, and <a href="http://donttrack.us/">private</a>. Over the last month I&#8217;ve still used other Google services and products (Chrome, Gmail, Google Voice, Google Authenticator, etc.) so it wasn&#8217;t a complete separation from Google - but enough to remind me that innovation is still happening elsewhere.</p>

<p>As Google has shifted much of its energy from information to social, companies like DuckDuckGo are continuing to innovate and find better ways to provide the information that we live on.</p>

  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
