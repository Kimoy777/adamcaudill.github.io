  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, I am quite impressed with the progress the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/default.aspx">IE team</a> has made. IE7 stands to be the most impressive release so far, with many rendering issues resolved, rather impressive <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/15/552246.aspx">security</a> advances, and a great many improvements on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">standards compliance</a> front. I must applaud both the team, and Microsoft for making these moves.</p>

<p>By focusing on standards, instead of proprietary features that degrade the experience for everybody, developers can work towards a unified web, free of browser discrimination and hack filed code. It seems like the Redmond power house has finally started to see where IE needs to go to remain relevant for Web 2.0, and beyond.</p>

<p>Then again, that&#8217;s leaving <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/04/07/571198.aspx">TIME</a> out of the picture.</p>

<p><strong>Time up for TIME?</strong></p>

<p>While <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/behaviors/time.asp?frame=true">HTML + TIME</a> could prove to be a fun toy, due to its very nature - it&#8217;s a toy not everybody could enjoy. This is an older (introduced with IE5), proprietary technology that is fairly unknown, and not often used. While it does have some merits in its concept, any design technology that is intended to serve a single, closed platform is simply a bad idea.</p>

<p>Why Microsoft is taking another look at this, I&#8217;m really not sure. I&#8217;m holding out hope that they are cleaning up old, non-standard features in preparation for the next release. My fear is that they want to make another push with this out-dated, IE-centric technology.</p>

<p><strong>Holding out hope&#8230; </strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s hope they make the right call, and remove support for proprietary &#8216;features&#8217; such as this. IE7 has the chance to not only catch up with the other major players, but to help push the wide-spread adoption of standards compliance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the next three months or so I plan on more-or-less rebuilding all of my computers, and the network they sit on. This is going to be a fairly time consuming process, though I expect should be well worth it. This includes the addition on a couple new computers, as well as new hardware for the existing ones. Among the various changes is the move to a rack-mount environment, away from normal tower cases. I think this is going to be quite a project.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how things look now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Primary Desktop (WinXP, tower case)</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion Server (Win2000, tower case)</p></li>
<li><p>(Misc hardware strewn about)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>On to the changes&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Dell PowerEdge 2500</strong></p>

<p>The first (and largest) change is the addition of a used Dell PowerEdge 2500 server, that will server as a development SQL &amp; Web server. This will eliminate the need to be running SQL Server on my primary PC.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/powerfront.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/powerfront.thumbnail.jpg" alt="powerfront.jpg" /> </a></p>

<p>This was a beefy server in its day, though it&#8217;s somewhat underpowered for many of the more demanding projects servers have to deal with. This makes it a perfect development server. This allows a better view of the impact software can have on it, as well as being light on the budget, leaving money for more important things.</p>

<p>This box is currently setup with 1 PIII 933Mhz CPU (I plan on upgrading this), 512MB of RAM (it&#8217;ll be seeing at least a couple of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820999201">these</a> in the rebuilding process), and <strong>6</strong> 18.2GB SCSI HDs. So it&#8217;s far from top of the line, but it&#8217;ll be a great development box.</p>

<p><strong>Primary PC</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/23513141.jpg" alt="23513141.jpg" /></p>

<p>My primary desktop is also my primary development box, this is the most important box on the network. Right now it&#8217;s a Windows XP box, and will see the fewest changes of all the systems I have. The only major change will be moving it from it&#8217;s existing tower case to a CODEGEN 4U-500-CA rack mount case. This is part of the move to consolidate all of my hardware and get rid of the &#8216;towers on top of towers&#8217; issue I have now.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve tried to migrate from a tower to a rack-mount, so there may a couple &#8220;gotcha&#8217;s&#8221; that I&#8217;ve not anticipated, I&#8217;m hoping this is a smooth move.</p>

<p><strong>Subversion Server</strong></p>

<p>For an existing system, the subversion server will see the most changes. This server started out as my desktop, and has by now been relegated to the role of hosting subversion, and thats about it. To make this box more useful, I plan on adding a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16816220001">SABRENT RAID controller</a>, as well as a couple Western Digital <a href="http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=137">160GB SATA</a> drives (I&#8217;ll add a couple more latter). This will allow it to server as not only the subversion server, but also as a file archive server.</p>

<p>The other change for this server is the move to the CODEGEN 4U-500-CA rack mount case, the same one I&#8217;m using for my PC. getting these boxes all in a rack will be quite nice I think.</p>

<p><strong>KVM</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/p11381a.thumbnail.jpg" alt="p11381a.jpg" />As a use a single keyboard/monitor for my separate computers, a KVM is a must. I&#8217;ll be replacing my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/FUL1_F1DL102P.jpg">existing</a> KVM, with a new one from JustCom. Based on the reviews I&#8217;ve seen, the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817107056">JC-104PE</a> looks like a nice choice for my needs, while trying to keep to a tight budget.</p>

<p><strong>Firewall / Router
</strong></p>

<p>After doing some research, and speaking to Andrew about his ideas (see comments), I&#8217;ve opted to pick up an older rack mount server from eBay, and using that as a firewall / router / VPN. It will most likely be running <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, and using IPTables as the basis for the firewall functionality. This will eliminate the need for my current Linksys router.</p>

<p>Using a single box as the firewall &amp; router should provide excellent performance, and be very secure.</p>

<p><strong>Switch</strong></p>

<p>The Linksys router is being replaced, adding the need for a new switch. I&#8217;ve opted for the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817111021">D-Link DGS-1008D</a>, this is a Gigabit switch, and should bring a real speed boost over the current 100Mbit network.</p>

<p><strong>Linux PC</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/linux-penguin%5B1%5D.thumbnail.jpg" alt="linux-penguin[1].jpg" />This will probably be one of the last steps in the rebuild process. I&#8217;m going to be using the same CODEGEN 4U-500-CA case, along with an ASUS motherboard to form the basis of this system. This will most likely be running <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/preview.html">SUSE 10</a>, this will give me two fairly modern PCs, one for Windows development, one for Linux development. I image once that&#8217;s setup, most of my PHP work will be done from there, should prove much easier than working on Windows.</p>

<p><strong>The Rack</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to figure out what I&#8217;m going to do for a rack to hold all of this. This is stall an open item in my plan.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts? </strong></p>

<p>If anybody has any ideas or comments about the direction I&#8217;m heading, or the products I&#8217;m using, feel free to let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft recently moved to release their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/default.mspx">Virtual Server 2005</a> software for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/software/default.mspx">free</a>. This is a somewhat unexpected, yet not surprising move by the software giant. With the fairly recent move to release a free edition of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>, as well as recent strides in the Linux Virtualization space; the pressure on Redmond to deliver is clear.</p>

<p>This is a major step, and could have an interesting impact on the market. I&#8217;m wondering if we won&#8217;t see another Media Player vs. RealPlayer, or Internet Explorer vs. Netscape type battle (though at a smaller scale). By releasing this as a free product, they are walking into the same situation that has landed them in court several times before.</p>

<p>This could turn into a good show, might be worth watching to see what happens next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoy what I do, and though I work in a chaotic environment, I really do love my job. Being in the Software Development industry has some really nice perks, being a developer in today&#8217;s world really is a great thing. Development isn&#8217;t easy though, it is quite mentally demanding; clear focus is of paramount importance. Without absolute focus, progress will only be a dream. This fact is a key player as to what makes being in this industry so great.</p>

<p>That is, if you aren&#8217;t a monkey.</p>

<p>In the time I&#8217;ve spent so far at my current company, I&#8217;ve come to understand just how clear the separation is of the two primary developer types. From all of my previous contracting work, I believed that the differences between the two sides of the fence were minimal. Wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The Fence </strong></p>

<p>There are, fundamentally, two types of developers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monkeys - Developers that work as part of the IT department of a larger company.These developers create software primarily for internal use.</p></li>
<li><p>Superstars - Developers that build software that primarily used externally.These developers typically write software that is sold commercially.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These two groups form the basis of the industry, and how the two are treated. While one could say that &#8220;a developer is a developer, right?&#8221; - That is not only quite wrong, it&#8217;s sadly misinformed. The line between the two is quite clear, at to me, clearer than ever.</p>

<p><strong>The Difference </strong></p>

<p>The difference between the two largely comes down to how they are treated, and the respect they receive. There is an entire list of small differences, here&#8217;s a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Interruptions - Our monkeys tend to receive far more interruptions, providing a constant source of distractions. This causes the developer to achieve less productivity, and thus incur more pressure. The pressure typically comes in the form of increased distractions due to projects being late.</p></li>
<li><p>Creature Comforts - The superstars normally see more perks to make their life better, be it the very nice though oddly-shaped <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/aeron/">Aeron</a> chair (at a mere $900 each), or a retired <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/03/36322071_9b4f668819_o.jpg">airplane wing</a> - just to spruce up the place. That&#8217;s not to mention simple things like higher end PCs, or decent desks. These are things that our monkeys often have to learn to live without, as the budget is far too tight to allow the extra spending.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities - The monkeys in the industry often have far more projects that they own. This helps to contribute to the increases distractions, as well as further removing the ability to stay focused on a single task. With a dozen or more projects under a single developers ownership, the day-to-day issues of managing them all can be overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom - Superstars are often given a fair bit more freedom, both in what they work on, and in exploring new methods and technologies. This not only adds value for the company by staying on the cutting edge, but also for the developer. By staying on the cutting edge, it increases their marketability.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few simple examples, there are many, many more.</p>

<p><strong>The Reason</strong></p>

<p>This is a complex yet simple question. The same applies to the answer, simple in that it can be summed up in 3 letters, yet complex in its ramifications. The answer: ROI.</p>

<p>One of the most basic business metrics, Return on Investment, this is the key to how many managers see the world. With superstars this is an easily defined number; simply compare your net projects to what you are paying the developers for that project. While that won&#8217;t give you a complete picture due to other costs involved (such as marketing &amp; support), it does give you a starting point.</p>

<p>The picture with the monkeys is quite different in that there doesn&#8217;t exist a clear way to establish ROI for a developer, when there is no profit connected to their work. While we could use estimates, such as the cost of hiring a consultant, though that would be highly inaccurate, and is thus mostly ignored.</p>

<p>This is the issue, if management can&#8217;t place a dollar value on the development work currently underway, they simply will not see any business value in giving the developers what they need. It&#8217;s just that simple.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>I honestly wish there was an answer here, but there isn&#8217;t. Management doesn&#8217;t seem to grasp the importance of internal development in many companies, and I can&#8217;t say I see a change coming. This requires upper-level management to change their mindset when it comes to the nature of creating software, and IT in general.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s simple to sit here and explain what&#8217;s different and why, thinking of a way of leveling the playing field far less so. I&#8217;ve spent a fair bit of time trying to think of an answer, so far the only one that&#8217;s occurred to me is to either move to the other side of the fence, or become a consultant.</p>

<p><strong>The Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This article, in its first draft, also included a few addition personal details that did add to the motivation to write this. Among these, were the details of the computer that I was given when I started my current job. The system was a small Dell PC, 1.3GHz, 256MB RAM, and to complete the package, a 15-inch monitor. There were quite a few other, similarly annoying, details as well. Thankfully, at least some of these have improved (still far from what <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/05/02.html">FogCreek</a> offers though); I&#8217;ve opted to remove that section in the interest of fairness.</p>

<p>Originally, I had intended this to be more of a scathing look at working as a monkey, this was changed in hopes of finding a middle ground, so that hopefully this article will generate some useful feedback on the problem, and how best to address it. I would appreciate any constructive comments on this, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if there are any possible solutions (well, I&#8217;ll be happy with a step in the right direction).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visual Basic is at an interesting crossroads, it&#8217;s at a critical juncture between two paths. One path, it has followed since its earliest days, where simplicity and ease of use ruled over maintainability and solid design. The other, the longer, harder road, is that of design over ease. With the release of Visual Basic .NET, a major shift occurred in the direction the language is taking, though looking back now, nearly 5 years later, I&#8217;m finding myself concerned for the future of the language.</p>

<p>Before I go much further, let me give you some background so that you can have a clearer understanding of my perspective. I&#8217;m a VB developer, I work exclusively in Visual Basic, and quite honestly I do love the language. It&#8217;s productivity at it&#8217;s best. I started using VB5 and at some point, I&#8217;ve used every version since then. So while I will be saying some negative things about VB, this isn&#8217;t bashing the language, this is me trying to open people&#8217;s eyes to the state of a great language.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>The issues VB as a language is facing is the desire from Microsoft to keep long-time users around, while trying to advance the language. Instead of making a clean break, they are falling into the trap they fell into with Internet Explorer, where they continued to build on broken code, to ensure that thing would work the same way (the IE team is trying to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">get out of the hole</a>). This has resulted in a language that makes heavy use of crutches to prevent pre-.NET users from having to re-learn their language.</p>

<p>While backwards compatibility is a nice thing to offer, when you are making major changes to a language, sometimes it&#8217;s best to start over and break the mistakes of the past. I understood the forces at play when .NET was originally released, so it&#8217;s understandable that Microsoft would choose to add crutches to make the transition easier. All of 5 years and two versions latter, the picture doesn&#8217;t look any better.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the crutches included in .NET 1.0 &amp; Visual Basic 2002 were temporary and would fade out as new versions are released. Nope. Instead of removing this legacy support, they continue to add more as the marketing forces inside Microsoft push to get the remaining pre-.NET VB developers to migrate. This is the same thing that was being done with Internet Explorer, which when the next version, 7, is released, it will cause many web sites to either display improperly, or not function at all. They are breaking it to fix it, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll need to get to the same point with VB before it continues down the proper path.</p>

<p>As compatibility is continuously made a priority over good design, VB will continue to slip, and continue to carry the reputation the mistakes of the past gave it.</p>

<p>C# was created with a true, very logical OOP model, VB was developed with a concoction of the C# &amp; VB6 models, which is enforced by both the compiler and the Visual Studio IDE. These are not simply issues with the use of legacy methods, but the very model that the language is based on.</p>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s To Blame</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft, of course.. right? Wrong.</p>

<p>The problem lies with the developers that use VB, not those that develop it. The primary issue I see is that legacy developers are not investing in the training or education to use VB properly. They continue to use antiquated methods and models they learned from VB6 and its predecessors.  The issue is that they create a hybrid type of code, that doesn&#8217;t follow a logical OOP model, instead following the pseudo-OOP model processed by VB6.</p>

<p>VB.NET has the potential to be a truly great language, the main issue is its habit of thinking for the developer, C# was developed without the mistakes of prior languages, and has so far done very well as it can take full advantage of the .NET Framework. VB on the other hand is somewhat limited in that due to trying to partially emulate the object model and structure of its predecessor, it loses flexibility granted to the other .NET languages.</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it</strong></p>

<p>Great question.</p>

<p>The only answer I see is to stop using legacy functionality, and calls for Microsoft to clean up the model used. When writing code in VB or C#, the IDE &amp; compilers should produce virtually identical code. As it stands now, there is a significant difference in the code the compiler generates, the assumptions it makes (many of which can <em>not</em> be over-ridden).</p>

<p>Until developers stand up, and take responsibility for using the language in the way it should be, I doubt we&#8217;ll see any progress. We can hope things will change, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath. (Though, as a side note, C# is looking more appealing every day.)</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><img src="https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49e14cf9f67c48aad082dec4f106f19a?size=250" class="aligncenter"></p>
  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
