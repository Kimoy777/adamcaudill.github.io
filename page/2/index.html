<p>For a long time, “military grade encryption” has been a red flag for snake oil, over-hyped, under-performing garbage, so much so that it’s become a punchline. Anytime that phrase is seen, it’s assumed that the product is a joke - quite possibly doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>Since Snowden dropped his document cache, opening the world’s eyes to what’s been going on behind the scenes at what is likely the world’s most sophisticated attacker, NSA-Proof has become the new “military grade encryption” - marketing hype leading to instant ridicule by industry insiders. This phrase isn’t as simple though - the NSA isn’t a single dimensioned threat. So when talking about defenses, you have to think about not just avoiding the NSA, but avoiding the various attack classes they leverage.</p>

<h3>Fighting NSA Programs</h3>

<p>When people talk about resisting the NSA, what exactly does that mean? As the NSA runs many programs, we have to look at the programs to see what could (or couldn’t) be real resistance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora">Tempora</a></strong> (and similar projects) that tap backbone links, siphoning data en mass for later processing. Projects like this gather as much as possible, with no concern for who’s data they are looking at.</p>

<p>These efforts are passive, they see what’s going over the fiber, but without changing it. So encryption, even opportunistic (which I’m <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/02/25/on-opportunistic-encryption/">really not a fan</a> of), prevents them from getting useful data. So TLS is NSA-Proof, from this very specific angle - it prevents them from <strong>passively</strong> collecting this data.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a></strong>, the infamous project whose exact role and function is still being debated. Metadata is king, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/ex-nsa-chief-we-kill-people-based-on-metadata/">metadata kills</a>. Metadata is easier to understand in bulk, and far easier to process than actual content for most (if not all) types of communication. Once you have enough of it, it’s far more valuable than the content it went with.</p>

<p>Want to protect against PRISM? Easy, kill all of the metadata. For a service provider, the less they know, the less they can be forced to hand-over. Email for example, is loaded with useful metadata, data that’s easily mined and correlated. Services and protocols that are being developed to be PRISM resistant are doing so by encrypting as much as possible, and minimizing the exposed metadata.</p>

<p>So, NSA-Proof is possible here as well, in a very specific angle. It’s harder to protect against than something like Tempora, but still doable with the right design.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations">TAO</a></strong> What about TAO, the NSA’s version of the special forces? Guarding against wide-scale NSA data collection is one thing, targeted activities are a different story.</p>

<p>I once suggested a <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2013/09/06/making-android-nsa-proof/">method for making Android NSA-Proof</a> (it involves thermite, so it’s fun too!), and if you are targeted by TAO, that’s probably the best bet. There are ways you can make their job harder, but as long as they can figure out where you are, there’s always the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/inside-the-nsas-leaked-catalog-of-surveillance-magic/">implant</a> option.</p>

<p>So can you be NSA-Proof from TAO? Probably not. You can make your odds better, but if they are willing to put the effort in, sooner or later they’ll win unless you are very well funded, and willing to take extreme measures.</p>

<h3>Marketing Hype</h3>

<p>Many journalists use similar terms, ‘NSA proof’, ‘NSA resistant’, ‘thwarting the NSA’, and a hundred others. While there’s a good chance it’s just more snake oil, it’s possible that there may be <em>some</em> truth to it.</p>

<p>When dealing with an adversary like the NSA - you have to consider which part of the NSA. They are after everyone with mass data collection, which is something that can be fought - with a high likelihood of success. Though as the the targeting becomes more focused, the odds start dropping. Once TAO is involved, only the best funded have any hope of resisting.</p>

<p>If a service claims to be ‘NSA-Proof’ - it could be true, to a limited extent. Such claims really need to be qualified; if a service makes this kind of claim, they should provide information of which programs (or program types) they are trying to resist.</p>

<h3>So, what does NSA resistance actually require?</h3>

<p>This, obviously, isn’t an easy question and depends very much on the nature of the service. Though there are a few high-level things to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong, non-NSA backed crypto primitives. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl</a> because it’s fast, constant-time, secure crypto that doesn’t rely on anything backed by the NSA. To make it easier to use, it’s made portable (and extended) in <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>. I won’t promote anti-NIST FUD, but some things should be questioned, such as the NIST ECC curves.</li>
<li>Minimal metadata. The amount of information that can be extracted from messages should be at a minimum. Anything that’s exposed (username, user ID, public keys, etc.) can be used when collected en mass to begin mapping relationships and undoing the veil of anonymity.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in transit. As with metadata, anything in the clear going over the network can be captured, stored, analyzed - and in targeted cases, altered in various ways. Using TLS is a great start to this, as it removes the option for simple passive monitoring, though it shouldn’t be assumed to be enough. Active attackers can man-in-the-middle the server, passing a forged/stolen certificate. Certificate pinning, and additional layers of encryption help protect against these attacks.</li>
<li>Server knows as little as possible. The more the server knows, the more the provider(s) can divulge - either by court order, or by more clandestine means. Even the simplest HTTP server logs can provide valuable information to such an attacker, especially when combined with other data sources.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in storage. When at rest, everything should be encrypted - if a device is compromised, it should reveal as little as possible. By encrypting everything based on the user’s password, only the user is able to access the data (though may be by force).</li>
<li>Hide everything. The CIA at least once used a weather application to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/germany-arrest-second-spy-accused-us-cia">hide a communication system</a>; it was only available when looking up weather for a certain city. Such techniques make it harder to spot the use of secure communication tools. This may seem a bit extreme, but there are good reasons to do it.</li>
</ul>


<p>There’s more of course, these are just a few high points. Defending against an adversary that has a huge budget, doesn’t respect international law, has a rubber stamp court, and some of the best technical talent in the world requires - special - measures. Of course, the NSA isn’t the only player; it goes beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>, every major power engages in such activity to some extent.</p>

<p>If you can provide a reasonable degree of protection against PRISM &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court">FISC</a>, then you can expect to have equal odds with other players using the same attacks. Will it actually work? Who knows; there’s a lot that can go wrong, a lot of mistakes that can be made, so many ways a good intentioned developer can turn a secure system into a thin facade that offers no protection. The list above is a starting point, not the final requirements.</p>

<h3>Can it really be achieved?</h3>

<p>Achieving real resistance to illegal surveillance is a huge challenge, but at least some degree of success can be had by taking simple measures. Ensuring that everything possible is encrypted, that all network traffic is encrypted, and the like will make it far more of a challenge for an attacker.</p>

<p>TAO-level resistance probably isn’t realistic, but lower levels are a real option, and should be pursued whenever possible. While calling anything ‘NSA proof’ should be seen as a red flag, there are real techniques to resist the NSA and other agencies that seek to invade the privacy of the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday James B. Comey, the Director of the FBI continued the propaganda campaign against encryption with a fresh batch of lies and misdirection. The FBI has been pushing to add backdoors to cryptosystems around the world - no matter how many people they put at risk in the process. Starting in the 1990’s, the FBI has been at the forefront of trying to make their job easier by endangering the world.</p>

<p>What Comey did today was to lay the foundation for a renewed push for a new, expansive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">CALEA</a> type law that would give <em>governments</em> access - via court orders or surreptitiously, to all of your data. In 2013 they were pushing for <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/calea-ii-risks-of-wiretap-modifications-to-endpoints/">CALEA 2</a>, which would have expanded their ability to secretly access your data in a massive way. Thankfully the Snowden documents put an end to that - at least for awhile.</p>

<p>I use the term governments instead of specifying the US Government very intentionally. Under CALEA, certain systems must be compliant to be sold in the US - so companies add support, and then ship them all over the world instead of supporting two versions. So the FBI’s desire to have easy access to anything they want puts people around the world at risk. But surely nobody would abuse this, right?</p>

<p>In 2004, thanks to support for this type of “lawful intercept” support, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%9305">Vodaphone in Greece was hacked</a> - tapping top government and civil leaders. Who did it still isn’t known, but many suspect that the US Government was behind it. Then there’s <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/">SOMALGET</a>, the NSA program to collect all calls made in the Bahamas. The DEA was given access to their phone systems for the purposes of “lawful intercept” - again, a CALEA compliant setup, which was then used to collect everything they were able to get. These are just two high profile examples, there are many cases where researchers have found flaws in these systems, making them easy prey.</p>

<p>For years, it’s been made clear that such backdoors were disasters - and it’s not just CALEA compliance either. There’s the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a> which would encrypt voice calls, but allow the government to easily listen in - but thanks to fatal flaws, anyone else could as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to this, pretty much everybody agrees that backdoors are a bad idea, so the FBI had a great idea - call it something else!</p>

<h3>A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p>Comey, deciding that he shouldn’t have to deal with reality, and that the best way to address the public was misdirection:</p>

<blockquote><p>We aren’t seeking a back-door approach. We want to use the front door, with clarity and transparency, and with clear guidance provided by law.</p></blockquote>


<p>And by “front door”, he means some new backdoor into everything.</p>

<p>He wants the ability to decrypt data, without having to get information from the suspect; which means adding a backdoor to systems, to allow them - and likely many others to get in. This is no different than the disastrous Clipper chip idea.</p>

<p>The FBI is trying to misdirect the public, lead them to believe in some magical, secure backdoor that is abuse-proof. But when such an idea is being pushed by an organization that has so much abuse and illegal activity in its history - should anyone trust what they say?</p>

<h3>Putting enforcement first</h3>

<p>At one point Comey said something that I found shocking:</p>

<blockquote><p>Are we so mistrustful of government—and of law enforcement—that we are willing to let bad guys walk away&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>If you read the US Constitution, this is answered for him - in many places it is made clear, it’s better to let a criminal walk free than to infringe on the rights of the innocent. Preserving the rights of the people trumps everything.</p>

<p>For law enforcement, this isn’t about justice, or the rule of law - this is about their power, their ability to get what they want, when they want it. If they put people in harms way in the process, that’s a price they are willing to let the public pay.</p>

<h3>Only one government?</h3>

<p>In the discussions about this, one major point keeps being missed - this isn’t just about the US Government, but about the governments all around the world. If companies are forced to add backdoors to products for the US market, you can bet that same backdoor will be shipped to every country they work in.</p>

<p>So the danger is global - but as this is something that can be used for intelligence, as CALEA has been used for in the past, I’m sure this fact hasn’t escaped the attention of planners at the NSA. For the NSA, a CALEA 2 style law would give them easy access to expend their already vast - and illegal - collection operations. It would be a dream come true.</p>

<p>There’s also another international component to this issue - many major tech companies operate in several countries, making them subject to local courts. What happens when they receive a court order for access to this backdoor and a gag order, to prevent them from talking about it? Suddenly American data will be at risk from foreign powers.</p>

<p>There are so many issues opened up when backdoors are added, that one could talk for days and still not cover all the ways it could be abused.</p>

<h3>Lies and mistrust</h3>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps it’s time to suggest that the post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far in one direction—in a direction of fear and mistrust.</p></blockquote>


<p>It seems that Comey is surprised that people don’t trust the government, after lies, deception, and violations of law are revealed. How shocking.</p>

<p>The US Government has failed to uphold the Constitution, and technology companies have stepped up to provide a level of protection in the face of a Government that has ignored its obligations. I’m sure that the FBI would love to go back the old days - where we assume the government is doing the right thing while secretly violating the Constitution and ignoring international law. Anything to give them more power and control.</p>

<h3>The New Crypto Wars</h3>

<p>In the 1990s, the first crypto war was fought, and many believed that the public had won. What we are seeing is, without question, that a new war has started. Apple’s decision to change the way they encrypt phones wasn’t what started it - the writing had been on the walls for some time, it was just the ammunition they were waiting to go on the attack.</p>

<p>Those that work with cryptography daily fighting to protect users, while the government is busy trying to protect what they want, over the rights and protection of the people. Expect it to get ugly.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a fight, and what happens in the next year or two will be critical. If the FBI wins, privacy dies.</p>

<p><em>(Sorry for the ranty nature of this post - it’s an issue I feel strongly about, and something that we must take action on.)</em></p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, <a href="http://www.brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave a talk on BadUSB at DerbyCon - I wrote some <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">about it yesterday</a>. Yesterday, Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/code-published-for-unfixable-usb-attack/">published</a> an article on the talk, kicking off several others - only the authors of the Wired and <a href="http://threatpost.com/badusb-attack-code-publicly-disclosed">Threatpost</a> articles contacted us for input.</p>

<p>There has been some questions raised as to the responsibility of releasing the code - so I want to take a few minutes to talk about what we released, why, and what the risks actually are.</p>

<h2>What we released.</h2>

<p>We released a two patches to the existing (v1.03.53) firmware for the Phison 2251-03, and a minimal custom firmware for that same chip.</p>

<p><strong>The Patches</strong></p>

<p>First, let me briefly describe the patches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden Partition - A patch to create a second hidden partition, to show that data can be hidden, and not easily accessed unless you know the trick.</li>
<li>Password Bypass - A patch to modify the password protection mechanism to force the password to fixed value; so that any password will be accepted. Must be applied before the password is set by the user.</li>
</ul>


<p>The second patch does defeat a “security” mechanism on the device, though given that the patch must be applied before the password is set - it’s not a huge risk to users. We intentionally focused on changing behavior instead of adding composite devices, to show that the is more complex than what was displayed at the Black Hat talk.</p>

<p>So we’ve bypassed one security feature, and added a new feature.</p>

<p>The patches were carefully selected to make the point, while not endangering users.</p>

<p><strong>The Custom Firmware</strong></p>

<p>The custom firmware acts a HID device, typing out a pre-programmed payload when inserted to a computer. This is anything but new - this can be done with a <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">USB Rubber Ducky</a>, a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>, or a number of other devices.</p>

<p>This was released to prove the point that the device could be reprogrammed to be something completely different. If this is a new threat to anyone - they are very out of the loop.</p>

<p><strong>The Tools</strong></p>

<p>We also released a few tools that we developed to apply patches and to make our lives easier during the effort. Most of what they do is available in other tools from Phison or the device manufactures; we built the tools we needed, so we didn’t have to use third-party tools or deal with the limitations of those tools.</p>

<h2>What we DIDN’T release</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about what was released, let’s talk about what it isn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Self replication</strong> - There’s no self replication code anywhere, while it’s possible that it could be done, and we’ve talked about how to do it - it won’t be released.</p>

<p>I am confident that we (Brandon and I) could build a system that would infect PCs, then infect a significant percentage of thumb drives, and then infect other PCs - but, and this is a <em>big</em> but - what we released doesn’t make that easier in any significant way.</p>

<p>Your average script kiddy will never be able to do it; there’s only a small number of people that would be able to do the work needed to be able to pull it off - those people could already do it before we released what we did.</p>

<p>The threat of this happening is the same as it has always been.</p>

<p><strong>Malware</strong> - There’s nothing malicious about what we’ve released here. While we did release a patch to modify the password protection feature - that’s all it does. It doesn’t modify data, infect computers with anything, or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>It changes the way a feature works. That’s it. This is a change that anyone with the required skills could have made - by making it public, we are raising awareness that users shouldn’t blindly trust.</p>

<p><strong>The end of USB as we know it</strong> - Nothing, nothing, that we’ve released has suddenly made new attacks possible. The USB specification allows composite devices to do unexpected things. USB devices (thumb drives or otherwise) that allow anyone to update the firmware without any checks, means that anything can potentially be reprogrammed to change functionality or become malicious.</p>

<p>All of these things have been true long before we released the first line of code. Anyone that believes otherwise doesn’t understand the technology.</p>

<p><strong>An unfixable issue that will end the world</strong> - While there isn’t quick fix for this, things can be improved quite a bit. We released simple code, that proves the issue, draws attention to the fact that users need to be more careful, while being careful to not cause more harm than good in the process.</p>

<p>This isn’t earth shattering. Anyone that thinks that it is, should probably give up and go live in a cave.</p>

<h2>The Risks</h2>

<p>What are the real risks here - what does this expose users to that it didn’t in the past?</p>

<p>Writing code for these devices is far from easy, especially when trying to patch the existing firmware. It’s not something that just anyone can jump into - while we have made it easier for people to apply simple patches and provided some insight to the process, these aren’t the patches that will lead to a firmware based worm or something of that nature - these are the type of patches that will make small changes to existing features, or add simple new features. Even then, it’s time consuming and difficult work.</p>

<p>So, to do anything still requires a lot of knowledge and skill - in general, as I said earlier, the kind of people that have what it takes to do this, could do it regardless of our release.</p>

<p>If a person (or group) was so inclined to take one of these devices and make it truly malicious - it’s unlikely that our research would have an impact.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that by releasing this code, the risk to the average user isn’t increased at all over what it already was.</p>

<h2>Why release?</h2>

<p>Device manufactures were quick to dismiss the “BadUSB” threat - on one hand, what was presented at Black Hat was possible via other means, so wasn’t really a new threat - but they showed no indication of trying to address the issues under their control.</p>

<p>For years devices have been sold with updatable firmware, but with no security checks at all - we had two goals with the release of the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>User awareness - As long as users implicitly trust devices, attacks will be possible and successful.</li>
<li>Push device manufactures to implement signed updates.</li>
</ul>


<p>While it will take years for any changes made by device manufactures to have an impact because of the number of devices in circulation now - if they keep ignoring the issue, then it will never be improved.</p>

<p>In doing this, we haven’t broken the security of these devices, but made it clear that it isn’t existent. If anyone is upset that we’ve removed the obscurity that had “protected” these devices - then to them I’m sorry that they understand so little that they believe that it’s real protection.</p>

<p>Part of the reason we released the “hidden partition” patch was to show that this can be used to add new features, that can add value in certain cases.</p>

<h2>The Full Disclosure debate</h2>

<p>When we started on this, we were concerned that this was being touted as a new threat, yet for defenders there was no way they could even test it, much less develop defense techniques.</p>

<p>So not only do we have something that defenders can’t test, we have something that the device manufactures are downplaying or ignoring. This is the setup for the classic full disclosure debate.</p>

<p>The first question that we asked ourselves, before we wrote the first line of code, is what is best for users? To allow the status quo to continue, or to expand the research into new directions and publish - to help make users aware and provide defenders something to work with.</p>

<p>The answer we came up with, is that we could develop patches that would clearly communicate the issue, without causing undue harm to end users.</p>

<p>In the end, looking at what we intended to release, what could be done that wouldn’t have been possible before that (which is fairly minimal), and the potential benefit - we felt, and still do, that full disclosure was appropriate.</p>

<p>In everything we’ve done, the priority has been protecting users - any media report that indicates otherwise is ill-informed, and providing bad information to the public.</p>

<h2>Breaking out of the echo chamber</h2>

<p>Given that the issue was so well known, the amount of attention - positive and negative - that this has received has really surprised us. It’s too common that when something like this is released it stays within the infosec echo chamber - this has broken out far more than I expected.</p>

<p>Most of the negative feedback has been from people and organizations that are well outside of the echo chamber - reminding me of just how ignorant the public can be when it comes to technical issues.</p>

<p>There are times that I wonder why we work so hard to protect these people.</p>

<h2>Has this been blown out of proportion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week <a href="http://www.brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I were honored to speak at <a href="https://www.derbycon.com/">DerbyCon</a>, on the work we’ve been doing on the Phison controller found in many USB thumb drives. This was my first time speaking at DerbyCon - it’s a great event, with a fantastic team making the magic happen.</p>

<p>Now that the dust has settled, I would like to provide some updates, thoughts, and extra information - and <em>maybe</em> correct an error I made during the presentation.</p>

<h3>The Demos</h3>

<p>We did three demos - they were simple enough that I didn’t think there was any risk of having issues. Well, lesson learned.</p>

<p>The machine we used was a fresh Windows install just for the talk - though in the rush, there were a couple differences between it and the machine we had been testing with. In the panic of trying to get the talk done in the short 25-minute slot, I mistook these differences for a failing of one of the demos.</p>

<p><strong>Custom HID Firmware</strong></p>

<p>The first of the three demos was a completely custom firmware, that presents itself as a HID device (and as a mass storage device, though without media present - this is to make firmware updates easier) - the demo went without a hitch.</p>

<p>I would have liked to show the tools and the update process, though there just wasn’t time. Brandon is working on videos that will be posted to YouTube that walks through each demo step by step.</p>

<p>The team behind the <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">Rubber Ducky</a> saved us a lot of time, thanks to the tools they had built - as we were able to support the same encoded format they used.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden Partition</strong></p>

<p>The hidden partition is a great patch, as there’s no way to tell that it’s there - everything works as expected, no reason to suspect that anything has been altered.</p>

<p>It divides the NAND space into two partitions, and the firmware lies about the size, to indicate that only half of the space is there. The “public” section is the first that’s mounted, and only a specific action will cause the second, hidden partition to become visible.</p>

<p>It’s a simple change, but it sends a clear message that there can be more than meets the eye with these devices. From a forensics perspective, the only way to ensure that what you are getting is accurate and complete, is to dump the NAND directly - without allowing the controller to access it.</p>

<p><strong>Password Protection Bypass</strong></p>

<p>This demo <em>seemed</em> to go wrong, but it actually performed perfectly - I was just in too much of a rush to think though what was happening, and why I didn’t see what I expected.</p>

<p>When I plugged the device in, I was expecting to see two drives from it - one “public”, the other unmounted. I only saw one. Two things went wrong here:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Show Empty Drives In Explorer” - By default Windows doesn’t show unmounted removable drives in “My Computer”; this is a setting I always change, and expected to see the unmounted drive. As this was a fresh install, the default setting was still set - the drive was there, I just couldn’t see it. This threw me off.</li>
<li>Wrong Password - During the demo I typed in some random junk to the password field of the “Lock” tool, and instead of it unlocking the drive as expected, it gave me the wrong password dialog. The issue here is a bug in the Phison code, when supplying a password more than 16 characters long it treats it as a bad password. So it was working, but the password I supplied was too long, triggering that bug.</li>
</ul>


<p>We later tested that drive again, and sure enough - it worked flawlessly, as long as the random password wasn’t longer than 16 characters.</p>

<p>The patch works by altering the buffer that stores the data once received over USB; it forces it to 16 “A”s, so that any password will work. Because of how it works, the patch must be applied before the user sets their password - otherwise it’ll just make the data inaccessible.</p>

<p>That was painful.</p>

<h3>The (maybe) error…</h3>

<p>During the talk I referred to modes 7 and 8 as being encrypted - this is <em>probably</em> wrong, at least on the devices we demoed. The two modes are password protected, and according to some documentation are encrypted, and according to other documentation they aren’t.</p>

<p>The question came up in a conversation after the talk - we’ve not had the time to dig into this feature more since then, but it’s looking like it’s just a password check with no encryption.</p>

<p>The password changing patch was added at the last minute, to replace another demo that we didn’t like - we identified the USB command being sent, and patched it. Due to time constraints we didn’t dig into the feature to verify the document (from a device manufacturer) was correct; after the question was raised we dug into a little more and looked for other documentation and code to support the claim - it looks like the document we were referencing was incorrect.</p>

<p>So, it looks like I misspoke - the patch still works as expected, though the feature itself seems to provide less protection than we initially though. Sorry!</p>

<h3>The Code &amp; Docs</h3>

<p>We have everything on the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">repo</a> now, and we’ve added some additional documentation to the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t simple to do - the code is complicated to write, and the effort to use the patches and custom firmware is a bit more than I’d like. We’ve tried to document things as well as we can, hopefully it’s easy enough to understand.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>We really hope that releasing this will push device manufactures to insist on signed firmware updates, and that Phison will add support for signed updates to all of the controllers it sells.</p>

<p>Phison isn’t the only player here, though they are the most common - I’d love to see them take the lead in improving security for these devices. They have an opportunity to stand up and protect users - as the most common provider of these controllers, I’d truly love to see them take this as an opportunity to lead the industry.</p>

<p>What we’ve released just scratches the surface of what can be done here - until signed updates are enforced, there’s no telling what games these devices could be playing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early last week I emailed a group of IETF Area Directors, for the Security and Applications areas, asking them to start the process of creating a new Working Group to address the issues around email security. (Thanks Adrian Farrel for the prodding!)</p>

<p>Today, the first result of the effort has been completed - the new <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/endymail">endymail</a> mailing list. An IETF venue to discuss how these issues can be addressed, hopefully laying the ground work updated standards to improve email as we know it today, and eventually standardizing a replacement to SMTP and related protocols. Here&#8217;s the description that the group came up with for the new list:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is significant interest in improving the<br/>privacy-related properties of Internet mail. One focus of<br/>current efforts is on the per-hop (connection-based)<br/>protections provided by TLS. However a wide range of other<br/>work has a focus on end-to-end protection, at the Internet<br/>scale of billions of end users and perhaps millions of<br/>operators.  Such work typically involves new forms of mail<br/>header or body protection, new public key management<br/>(compared to S/MIME or PGP), and security mechanisms more<br/>appropriate for mobile/web user-agents.  Other<br/>security-relevant approaches may be discussed if needed.<br/>Various proposals and development efforts on this topic are<br/>underway outside the IETF. This mailing list provides an<br/>IETF venue for discussion of elements that might be commonly<br/>needed by such efforts and to identify work that the IETF<br/>could do to aid in achieving better end-to-end security<br/>deployed for Internet email.</p></blockquote>


<p>While the creation of another mailing list is far from ground breaking, it&#8217;s the necessary first step in standardizing a solution to a decades old problem.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone interested in email security and privacy to join the list, and participate in the discussions that will lead to new standards. (Though please wait a bit for people to subscribe before starting discussions.)</p>

<p>A big thanks to Stephen Farrell, Joe Hildebrand, and Pete Resnick for their enthusiastic support for this effort.</p>
