  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometime in the 1990’s I used a 2400-baud modem and connected to the internet for the first time; I found a new world, a better world. A world where ideas and intellect set people apart, not skin color, or political affiliation, of even the pseudo-scandal of the day (which is probably just a disguise for ignorance and intolerance).</p>

<p>It was a time of invention, in a world where everything was new and the potential was unlimited. It was magic - not the fake Hollywood magic, but real, life changing, nothing can hold you back magic. The only real restriction was your own mind (and maybe your long-distance bill).</p>

<p>Before too long I ran across a short essay that reinforced my view of the internet, and my philosophy towards people in general - <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>. While it resonated with me at the time, as it reflected my life so well, it was one small passage that really mattered to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias&#8230; and you call us criminals.</p><footer><strong>Loyd Blankenship</strong> <cite>The Conscience of a Hacker</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>One simple line, yet such a profound statement. The internet I grew to love was a different world — national borders meant nothing, the freedom to speak your mind was simply assumed for all without question. Governments didn’t understand it well enough to care, and so it was ignored. A different kind of society was allowed to evolve — a society that valued people and intelligence greater than political or religious affiliation. A society where anyone, even a poor kid from the middle of nowhere could have a real impact on the world.</p>

<p>There was of course conflict, and egos, and the ever increasing encroachment of money that would change everything; but in general, it was good — better than any nation I was aware of.</p>

<h2>Utopia Lost</h2>

<p>Today, Solar Designer was commenting on Intel <a href="https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551496338995937280">shutting down</a> certain Russian-language content due to a rather <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russian-blogger-law-puts-new-restrictions-on-internet-freedoms/2014/07/31/42a05924-a931-459f-acd2-6d08598c375b_story.html">horrible Russian law</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people and most countries are their own worst enemies…</p><footer><strong>Solar Designer</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551498166366142465'>twitter.com/solardiz/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>From the early, government ignored days of the internet, certain rights were assumed for all users — it was never written, but at the time it seemed that the internet was beyond any one government. It belonged to humanity, it was for the people. Of course, looking at the history of the internet, this is somewhat amusing, but it’s the way many felt, and it seems many still do.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech, freedom to speak anonymously, and so many others were granted by the internet to people that in the past had never had them. This great invention, this great network of people, had become the greatest tool of equality ever. Such things seem doomed.</p>

<p>As Solar pointed out - countries are their own worst enemies - in this case a horrible law is not only impacting the freedom of speech, but also to avoid the complications it introduces (and other similar laws recently enacted), companies are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-pulls-out-of-russia-2014-12">pulling out of Russia</a> or disabling functionality for Russian users. So the Russian people lose, the economy is impacted, everybody loses something when such mistakes are made.</p>

<p>Of course, this is far from a unique case — the old internet, the free, open, good for humanity internet is all but dead. It’s been a long time since governments discovered what they had ignored for so long, and that an international bastion of freedom had formed under their noses.</p>

<p>Censorship becomes more pervasive every day, the monitoring by the FIVE EYES countries - and who knows who else - is so pervasive that one has to now assume that anything not (securely) encrypted is being seen and analyzed by many. Malware vendors grow rich, by leveraging the greatest invention in human history as a tool for repression and even death. In Russia, exercising an innate human right can <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045">send you to prison</a>, in Syria, <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/syrian-video-blogger-reportedly-killed-in-homs-as-shelling-continues/?_r=0">it can get you killed</a>.</p>

<p>Complacency, subterfuge, infighting, and carelessness have allowed those with power and money to take more more control than they ever should have. Groups like the MPAA are still busy pushing bad laws, trade treaty negotiations continue to risk further censorship, and anti-terror laws are increasingly being aimed at online speech instead of legitimate threats.</p>

<p>The internet I fell in love with was a bastion of freedom. May it long be defended, even if all that’s left is the memory, and the idea of what it could again become.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by a post from <a href="https://scott.arciszewski.me/blog/2014/12/year-2014-reflection">Scott Arciszewski</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and publish a year in review post. This is something that I&#8217;ve generally avoided in the past, as the tone of these posts is more often than not, just cynicism and negativity. After seeing Scott’s post, it made me think about how such a review can be used to send a positive message — something desperately needed.</p>

<p>Year after year, we see predictions, projections, and sales pitches — and the cynical responses that they always generate. It&#8217;s so easy to spend time rolling our eyes at vendors and media, instead of looking forward to ways to improve the situation and make the world a better place — even if only in a tiny way. We may not be able to fix the stupid, but we can at least reduce the damage that it does.</p>

<h2>2014 In Review</h2>

<p>So, without further ado, a personal look back at 2014.</p>

<h3>Security Research &amp; Related</h3>

<p>Overall this has been a very busy year, and I’ve not been able to publish as much as I’d like. In total, I requested only a single CVE for the entire year - <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2890">CVE-2014-2890</a> (I don’t keep a count of how many security related tickets I open, so no idea how many issues I actually reported).</p>

<p>Most of my time was instead spent on a couple projects - <a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson</a> (BadUSB firmware). I’ll talk more about these later.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to spend as much time on public application security work as I had intended, but I did get some reports in, some advice given, some progress made.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>

<p>In 2014 I was fortunate to be asked to speak on a few occasions. When preparing for a talk, I always have mixed emotions — on one hand, it&#8217;s always been a great experience, a chance to meet new people, share knowledge, and hopefully contribute to the community. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a significant amount of time that is lost — and time is without a doubt my most limited resource.</p>

<p>Whether it makes sense or not, I generally don&#8217;t give he same talk twice — especially if the event is recorded. So for each talk, it&#8217;s a real time &amp; energy commitment. I very much hope that those that have seen my talks appreciated them, and got something out of them.</p>

<p>Here is some information from selected talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/08/16/smimp-at-the-defcon-cryptovillage/">SMIMP at the DEFCON Crypto Village</a></li>

<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/11/23/speaking-at-sc-magazine-congress/">Speaking at SC Magazine Congress</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>Personally, this has been a particularly trying year for me, for various reasons. I have, as I always do, made a real effort to not show what&#8217;s going on when things go wrong. So, for all my friends, and everyone else for that matter — if there were times I was distant or difficult, or evasive — I am truly sorry.</p>

<p>With that said, the year could have been far worse, and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for all the friends I have — old and new. It was a busy year, with much going on and never enough time to make everything that needed to happen, actually happen.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>During the year, much of my time was taken up by a couple projects — here is where they stand today:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a></strong> - Without a doubt the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve worked on, with a goal no less than replacing email itself. The first public draft was released in late July — and unfortunately remains basically untouched since then.</p>

<p>Shortly before I released the first public draft, a start-up tried to acquire the rights, so they could develop it, and build there own applications around it. By the time that I told them that I was more interested in making the specification public, they had offered me a position as co-founder in exchange for it.</p>

<p>This project took a substantial amount of time to get to a first draft — and really, it isn&#8217;t complete yet. Given the original goal of the project, leaving it with open issues really doesn’t bother me — that many more points to talk about.</p>

<p>The original plan for the effort was to spur discussion, to get people talking about how email could be replaced. To be secure, a system must be designed with certain goals and threats in mind - something that didn&#8217;t happen with email as we know it today. So to fix email, we need to replace it. SMIMP may not be the answer, but we need to do something.</p>

<p>Overall, though there was some positive feedback, I consider the project to be a failure. I&#8217;m proud of the work I did on it, but it didn&#8217;t have the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson (BadUSB Firmware)</a></strong> - Without a doubt the work that had the most people talking. It was a fun project, we managed to get some code in the hands of those that wanted to extend it.</p>

<p>It’s over, and I’m glad it’s over.</p>

<p><strong>Blog</strong> - This blog has also been a bit less active than I hoped — 16 posts with a total of 18,040 words. I’m pretty sure last year I said I’d blog more. Oops.</p>

<p><strong>My First Novel</strong> - A couple years ago I started occasionally working on an idea for a novel, this year, I set aside what I had been doing, and started fresh (but still based on the same material). My goal was to finish it this year, by there simply wasn&#8217;t enough time.</p>

<p>Writing is something that I have yet to determine if I&#8217;m actually good at - or if I just limp along enough for others to tolerate. While I could write a technical book with confidence, writing fiction is something that, quite intentionally, pushes what I&#8217;m comfortable with.</p>

<p>Making the time and finding the focus for something like this is certainly more difficult than I had imagined. I&#8217;ve come to understand why so many writers drink.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I have to say, I love the communities that I work with. I love that I get to deal with challenging problems. I love that I get to find solutions and make them work. But most of all, I’m thankfully for so many friends and great people that make this work truly enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Looking forward to 2015</h2>

<p>I have a number of goals for 2015, a number of projects that need my attention, and ideas to make the world just a little bit better.</p>

<ul>
<li>SMIMP - While I feel that the project generally failed, there doesn’t seem to be much movement in the let’s-kill-email space, so I don’t think it’s dead quite yet. There just might be another chance to get people talking about a real solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/CurveLock">CurveLock</a> - An open source, secure, modern encryption application. This is mainly an experiment - but the goal is to provide high security, in a simple, easy to use application. Hopefully will get a beta out before too long.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EncryptingCamera/encryptingcamera-spec">EncryptingCamera</a> - Prompted by a conversation on Twitter, a few people got together to make a new application that will hopefully protect a few reporters — and others that need to take photos, and secure them from inspection.</li>
<li>Blog - Last time that I promised to blog more often, I didn’t post again for months, so I’m hoping that I don’t repeat that this time. But I promise to write more, and do my best to keep the content interesting.</li>
<li>Personal Transparency - I’ve always been very concerned with my professional image, and as such tend to keep many details of my life to myself. One personal goal for this year is to be <em>just a bit</em> more open and transparent.</li>
<li>Novel - I intend to have either a deal signed with a publisher, or to publish as an ebook on Amazon before the end of 2015. One way or the other, I’ll be done with it by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Research - I plan on spending more time evaluation open source applications for security issues. In just a few hours a week, can have a real impact on making applications and users more secure.</li>
<li>Open Source Security Tools - I hope to dedicate a reasonable amount of time on new and existing tools to make users more secure, especially when it comes to secure communication. PGP/GPG hasn’t aged well - tools like <a href="https://github.com/tedu/reop">reop</a> have a lot of technical potential, but usability still needs to be improved.</li>
<li>More time outside of the echo chamber - It’s easy to stay inside of the echo chamber, agreeing with ourselves (or disagreeing), but what good does it really do? To have a real impact, we need to spend more time influencing the people that need our help the most.</li>
<li>Consume less, create more - In general, consume less and create more — time is a precious and limited resource, should be used to do as much good as possible.</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh, and one final note for next year - my wife and I are expecting again. Should be an exciting year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[Note: This is satire / fiction; well, more or less - probably more more than less. Any resemblance to real companies, living or dead, is purely coincidental.]</em></p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C — Unnamed White House officials that spoke on the condition of anonymity, have stated that a major American company has been hacked, and the attackers are threatening to release terabytes of proprietary information. The name of the company has not been released at this time.</p>

<p>The officials say that the attack came from a state-sponsored attacker — the speed at which the attackers gained control of the company’s network, the focus on administrative credentials, and the sophistication of the previously unseen malware used in the attack. Based on IP addresses used, the attack has been tied to Belize.</p>

<p>Security researchers from Mendyant Security are working a new report, to be released next week. They have dubbed this new group APT3.14159 - and have identified prior attacks that share similarities with the new attack revealed today. They have identified the attackers as Unit 26478 of the Belize Defense Force.</p>

<p>Officials from the Belize Defense Force refused to comment on this story.</p>

<hr />

<p>“I just talked to the CEO, he wants hourly updates on our findings. Now that the FBI, and Mendyant Security is involved, he wants to know, real time, what’s going on and what we’ve found” said Bob, the middle-age middle-manager that had no experience with security, but accepted the position because it paid more.</p>

<p>“Bob, there are three of us, you have three analysts on the team - we are the entire security team, and we’ve been working for two days straight so far. We’ve had to shut down the entire network - even the core switches are down. We can’t access anything, the US data center is in New York, and the secondary in in Japan. We’ve spent the last two days just collecting notes and making sure that everything was shut down. Here’s your update: we know nothing besides that we were hacked.”</p>

<p>Jerry, a tall, slender, over-worked security analyst had spent the last two days trying to contain a massive hack that liked impacted everything inside the company. Having only three analysts that could do anything useful - and multiple managers that wanted constant updates so they would appear useful - the team was exhausted, confused, and unable to do anything at this point.</p>

<p>The attackers had sent company executives screenshots and file listings from the data they had collected, and demanded a ransom or they would release the data and destroy their systems - the executives couldn’t make anything of it, so assumed it wasn’t important. The security team wasn’t made aware of the emails until workstations started dying.</p>

<p>Two hours after the deadline passed, workstations throughout the multinational company started to fail. At first, the local technicians assumed it was just an unusual rash of hardware failures. By 9AM Eastern the next day, over 3,000 machines had been reported offline, with the number impacted climbing rapidly.</p>

<p>Then, finally, someone called the Director of Information Security - but by unfortunate coincidence he was in a meeting until 10AM. When he finally talked to the technicians, the number reported had grown to 5,500 - he immediately called the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. Unfortunately though, she worked in the west coast, and didn’t start her day until noon eastern time. She immediately realized that something very bad was going on, and asked the Manager of Systems Security (Bob), to have his team of analysts look into it. Bob though, though it was an Information Services issue, and directed the issue to the Senior Manager for Systems &amp; Infrastructure. Two hours later, after traversing his chain of command, he determined it was a security issue, and sent it back to the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. By the time it landed back on her desk, at 2PM Eastern, the number on downed workstations was now over 10,000 and 500 servers. She again passed the issue to Bob, and at 3PM the analysts were finally aware that something had happened.</p>

<p>Once the small team of security analysts were finally made aware, they quickly started to do damage control - disabling all connections to the internet, disconnecting the separate physical sites, anything they could think of to limit the spread of whatever this malware is.</p>

<p>One of the analysts quickly pulled an image of one of the local manager’s laptop, and began to analyze it on her personal machine - all the security analysts assumed that their machines would be wiped too, so any serious work was done on their personal laptops. Within an hour she identified an unusual file, that was named similar to a critical Windows file, but wasn’t signed by Microsoft. She uploaded the file to VirusTotal - none of the engines detected it as malicious, nor did their antivirus software of choice. She noticed that it referenced a well known driver used in commercial software to wipe drives before disposing of them - this looked like the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Thanks to her quick work, they were able to get technicians at local sites to begin cleaning up - by then end of the day, only half of their machines had been wiped. Had it not been for her identifying it, all of their Windows workstations and servers would have been wiped.</p>

<p>“Well, what do I tell the CEO Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Tell him there’s nothing more we can do, so we went to bed. We’ll be back tomorrow-ish” - and with that, the entire team (all three of them) walked out the door.</p>

<hr />

<p>Inside a five story brick office building, on the outskirts of San Francisco a team of analysts for Mendyant Security study the limited logs available and the sample of the malware the Sone Corp analyst found.</p>

<p>From looking at the debug information and embedded strings, there were clear signs of Spanish and Kriol - a dialect of Creole that is common in Belize. The mix of languages in the strings and in the file paths led the analysts to conclude that it wasn’t the work of a single person, but a multilingual team.</p>

<p>The logs indicated that the malware was connecting to China, India, Spain, and Russia. After some initial analysis, all of the Command &amp; Control servers used a particularly old version of a content management system, and were easily hacked. The analysts decided that seeing as these servers were likely hacked, and that the easiest way to gather information from them was to go ahead and hack them and collect whatever information they could.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours, they were downloading full copies of all the data on each of the servers. Once downloaded, they would study the C&amp;C software to see if anything interesting is going on.</p>

<p>The C&amp;C software was written in PHP, and did fairly little on its own - most of the commands were relayed back to a hard-coded  IP on port 31337. The server at that IP was no longer online, so  one of the analysts contacted a security researcher that had been performing internet wide scans, asking if he had any information for that IP. They were lucky, his logs showed that an HTTP server came online on that server a little over six months ago, and disappeared on his last scan, just two days ago.</p>

<p>Looking up the owner of the IP, it was register to the Belize Defense Force. APT3.14159 was born.</p>

<p>The story is clear, hackers for the BDF hacked the C&amp;C servers, having them relay to their own server; once detected, the main server was taken off line.</p>

<hr />

<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. — Today, the FBI revealed that the major corporation attacked by hackers working for Belize, is Sone Corp., a entertainment powerhouse. The stock briefly dropped 5%, but closed the day with a minor increase.</p>

<p>Anonymous source within the government have revealed that they are completely confident that Belize is completely behind this, and other recent attacks. “There will be a price to pay for attacking American businesses - the administration is reviewing the options in response to this clear act of cyber-terrorism” - the source refused to be identified as they weren’t authorized to speak on the subject.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the media in a frenzy, the President was forced to make a statement, formally accusing Belize of attacking not only Sone Corp, but several smaller attacks over the last six months. The tone was harsh, there were promises of severe economic penalties. The United States would not tolerate such attacks.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Six months earlier…</em></p>

<p>In a small bar off of the Las Vegas strip, a small group of pentesters seek refuge from the chaos that is DEF CON. After a few rounds of top-self whiskey, one has a bright idea…</p>

<p>“I’d bet if we spent a few dollars to get a VPS in China, hacked the first military server we can - pull off a few attacks, within a few months we could get the U.S. Government &amp; some of these big security contractors to label us as a nation-state actor.”</p>

<p>“Nah, I’m sure they get the NSA TAO involved to verify before pointing fingers.”</p>

<p>“$1,000 says it’ll work.”</p>

<p>“You’re on.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few hours ago, a Grand Jury in New York decided that the video-taped murder of an unarmed man didn’t justify a trial to determine if those, clearly seen and identified, who killed him had broken any laws. The man I speak of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner">Eric Garner</a>. What struck me immediately, was the Orwellian undertones that this event has.</p>

<h3>Grand Juries &amp; Time Control</h3>

<blockquote><p>He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.</p><footer><strong>George Orwell</strong> <cite>1984</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In criminal cases brought before a Grand Jury to determine if there’s enough evidence that a person is guilty of a crime to justify being charged, the person that controls the past, is the prosecutor. Their responsibility is to present the evidence to the jury - documentation, photos, videos, testimony, etc. - to get them to bring charges, if there is enough to show guilt.</p>

<p>The show isn’t ran by the courts, as is the case with other parts of the justice system, but instead by the prosecutor, who has control over what the jury sees and hears. It is this power, this control over evidence, this control over the past, that allows them to, when they so choose, to take on an alternate role - defender.</p>

<p>In 1985, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler">Sol Wachtler</a>, the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals rather famously mused that a prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to - and based on numbers from the federal grand jury system, that seems very accurate. In 2010, federal grand juries returned indictments in 162,000 cases - and declined to do so in only 11.</p>

<p>For those that are outside of the law enforcement community, it’s clear that the grand jury is just a rubber stamp process. Yet, for those inside the system, its use is more delicate, more finessed - more directed. It’s easy for a prosecutor to get a jury to indict someone - but as recent events have shown, with enough time, they can take undeniable evidence and through careful tactics, sabotage their own case. Preventing the accused from being charged at all.</p>

<p>Suppress useful evidence, call questionable witnesses, present confusing and unclear information, question the integrity of everything presented - there are so many options available to ensure that the jury won’t see clear guilt. With some time, the prosecutor becomes the master of the past, painting the picture that he wants the jury to see - free from disagreement or dissenting views.</p>

<h3>Just a little doublethink…</h3>

<p>How much time, how many confusing statements, how many character assassinations does it take before a jury can see, with their own eyes, a murder - and by the skill of a great <del>defense attorney</del> prosecutor, accept that while they saw a murder, a murder didn’t occur?</p>

<p>Or, in this case, not only didn’t a murder occur - no crime at all occurred. He was murdered, and he wasn’t.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, this wasn’t a open trial - this was simply to determine if charges should be brought at all. In this case, the decision was that there will be no charges, no trial to determine if the killing was justified, no attempt at justice for the dead. Never will a real jury, in a court of law, hear the case and be able to make a determination based on the evidence - that determination was already made by the prosecutor.</p>

<p>A process that is a rubber stamp to those on the outside, becomes a free-pass for those on the inside of the system.</p>

<h3>…and justice for all.</h3>

<p>There is no justice in this case, nor illusion of justice. No thinly veiled farce of a trial to appease the masses. Nothing.</p>

<p>I must wonder, how much longer before such cases won’t even see the “light” of a secret grand jury, and just die on a prosecutors desk. When the prosecutor works to defend the accused - only when the accused is part of their system of course - why bother with the show, why even pretend to try. Justice isn’t their goal, protecting those on the inside, those that enforce is the goal.</p>

<p>Control, intimidation, and fierce reprisal to any that dare resist is the hallmark of enforcement today - “justice” is granted to the favored, retribution to the rest. Enforce and control has become the unspoken replacement to “protect and serve” - a statement that meant little, and now serves as an insult to those, that for one reason or another, find themselves outside of the “favored” group.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crimes committed by LEOs should be prosecuted by a special prosecutor; the risk &amp; impact of them acting as a defense attorney is too great.</p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/status/540249660947181568">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Who enforces against the enforcers? Who can be objective when dealing with a person inside the system that supports them? For any chance at justice, when a member of law enforcement is accused of a crime, it should be an outside prosecutor that brings the case to the grand jury. While there’s still risk of the prosecutor acting more as a defender, by appointing a special prosector from outside the normal system, there’s at least some chance that the grand jury will see the unaltered truth. Then, maybe, there will be a chance for real justice.</p>

<p>Change to the justice system in the United States is needed on many fronts, racism is rampant, intimidation and coercion have become normal, police are more militarized than the military, and the use of excess force is justified by any excuse. Killing a person should be the last, most desperate line of defense - not something excused by the slightest feeling of discomfort. Though as long as the grand jury can so easily act as a free pass, this change will never be achieved.</p>

<p>Things like body cameras, which the federal government is now supporting, are a step in the right direction. They eliminate questions, and allow the public to see, with their own eyes, what happens. But, no matter how many cameras are deployed to monitor law enforcement activity, if grand juries ignore evidence that’s inconvenient to a prosecutor’s goal, no crimes will be averted, no pointless deaths prevented.</p>

<p>The system is broken. Only by a feat of doublethink can anyone see anything else.</p>

<p><em>To my friends in law enforcement:</em> Please don’t take this as an attack against you. You have a hard job, and at times it’s certainly dangerous. But the system is broken, you may think my view is wrong - but your perspective is likely just as tainted. To those on the outside, to those that don’t have the benefit of being protected by the system - too often feel oppressed by the system, punished unfairly and in excess of reason. Please understand that there is a perspective that you, likely, can’t see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave the lunch keynote at the <a href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/link=16">SC Magazine Congress</a> event in Chicago. It was a fun, more executive level event - a big thanks to Eric Green and team. The talk was mostly an executive overview of what was discussed at <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">our DerbyCon talk</a>, with some updates, and some insights.</p>

<p>Here are the slides, and a rough transcript from the event:</p>

<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41900274" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p><em>(This is based on the speaker notes - so it doesn’t include the discussion and other bits that were said)</em></p>

<p><strong>Slide 2:</strong> (Adam) Hi, I&#8217;m Adam Caudill, I&#8217;m here today with Brandon Wilson, and we are here to talk about some research that we&#8217;ve been working on. We will be giving you some background information on BadUSB, showing it to you in action, and talking through the real risks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 3:</strong> (Adam) USB devices are truly ubiquitous - they are all around us. We all use them on a daily basis, but as is true for most technologies, the things that make our lives easier can be turned to attack us. This is a clear case of a technology that was designed to make life easier, but thanks to designers and implementers not fully understanding the potential for abuse, they have opened a door to attack vectors that most people don’t realize exists.</p>

<p>That USB is so common is both a blessing and a curse – from a convenience perspective, it’s great that USB devices and things that support USB are everywhere, but from a security perspective, there are costs, there are risks. Risks that few people realize that they need to be worried about.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 4:</strong> (Adam) BadUSB - the ability to take a seemingly harmless device and turn it into something evil, has been getting a lot of attention lately. We are here to talk about our findings, other research that&#8217;s going on, how this research can be extended, and what it means for those trying to defend against attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 5:</strong> (Adam) First, lets talk about what BadUSB isn&#8217;t - it&#8217;s not an exploit, it&#8217;s arguably not even a vulnerability. It&#8217;s not a flaw in a device, or an oversight in a protocol. BadUSB, really, part behavior by design, and part carelessness on the part of device manufacturers.</p>

<p>BadUSB was first publicized by the Security Research Labs team from Germany, their work started with looking into a way to reprogram thumb drives to perform data processing - this led them to realize that the technique they intended to use to add features, could also be used by attackers.</p>

<p>Their talk at Black Hat USA was the first time many people heard about the possibility for such issues. It&#8217;s their talk, and their decision to limit the details they released, that led us to change directions in some research we were doing, and get more details and code out to defenders.</p>

<p>Before we go too much further, lets talk just a little about USB, things most people don’t know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 6:</strong> (Brandon) When BadUSB was first introduced, the focus was on a design aspect of USB - something that has been used by legitimate designs for years, composite devices. In short, a composite device is a USB device that has multiple interfaces, or profiles, each exposing a different type of device. The classic case for BadUSB is a thumbdrive that is also a keyboard.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a vulnerability though - this is perfectly compliant with the USB specification. Devices are allowed to do this, it&#8217;s intended behavior and by itself is not a bad thing. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t just apply to being a mass storage device and a keyboard - NICs, printers, USB display adapters, webcams, and so on - any combination is possible.</p>

<p>So, for this part at least - it&#8217;s a feature, a feature that can be abused.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 7:</strong> (Brandon) To turn a thumbdrive into something more, it requires updating the device’s firmware - the code that resides on the device and makes it function. Many people see thumbdrives as just a data storage device, without realizing that there&#8217;s a programmable controller inside.</p>

<p>These controllers are often user updatable, meaning that with only some software, anyone can perform the update. Why would the manufacturer want to let people update the firmware on a flash drive, you might ask? Well, there can be bug fixes, improvements to how it communicates with the NAND memory inside, better bad block management, etc. Where this becomes a problem though, is that some of the largest controller vendors don&#8217;t enforce signed updates. So not only can any user update them, they can update them with any code they choose.</p>

<p>So this, the fact that they are selling chips that don&#8217;t have any security considerations at all, is what turns USB&#8217;s feature of allowing composite devices into a real attack vector.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 8:</strong> (Brandon) Using firmware as an attack vector is far from new though, it&#8217;s been done for years - though I don&#8217;t believe that most people realize that so much research has been done that shows how weak many devices are.</p>

<p>We’ll get into some examples a little bit later, but people were reprogramming Apple keyboards to appear as other devices years ago, and a decade ago I was making graphing calculators show up as flash drives, so this is by no means new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 9:</strong> Here is a picture of a typical thumb drive &#8211; there is the USB port of course, then that square controller chip which is the “brain” of the device (and what runs the firmware that makes the drive work), and then the NAND flash memory on the far left.</p>

<p>There are different vendors involved here &#8211; NAND comes from one company, controller from another, sold under another name, etc. They’re essentially just putting the parts together, so there are a lot of different combinations out there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 10:</strong> (Brandon) Let&#8217;s take a few minutes to talk about firmware&#8230;</p>

<p>For this talk, so we can have specific examples, we are going to talk about the Phison family of controllers - Phison is the largest maker of controllers used in thumbdrives, so that&#8217;s why we are picking on them.</p>

<p>In this case, the device has a small boot image built into the controller itself, which is responsible for loading the firmware from the NAND chip and executing it - through the use of special applications on a PC, users can update the firmware with different, or modified versions. This is something most users know nothing about - but it&#8217;s there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 11:</strong> (Brandon) Devices with updateable firmware aren&#8217;t inherently evil of course, but the question is, does it use signed updates. Which is to say, do the updates include a cryptographic signature, based on a protected private key that only the device manufacturer has access to. If the answer to that is no - the devices doesn&#8217;t validate the origin of updates, and it could be a target for a BadUSB style attack.</p>

<p>To be secure, devices need to validate all updates, using a non-updatable public key. This is the only way to ensure that the firmware is from a legitimate source, and not from some attacker. If the public key were updateable, then there&#8217;s the risk that with physical access, or by taking advantage of a flaw, the key could be changed to an attacker-controlled public key - making it impossible to restore the device to stock firmware.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 12:</strong> (Brandon) Even <em>if</em> a device uses only signed updates, that&#8217;s not a guarantee that it&#8217;s safe. There are many ways that an update system can fail - and it&#8217;s important to remember that once these systems are developed, they tend to not be updated, so they are often using old or even obsolete technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Weak signing keys. Texas Instruments found this out the hard way, when their 512-bit RSA signing keys for their graphing calculator line were factored and publicly released, allowing anyone to release signed updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification failures. There have been some systems that use signing - but never bother to actually validate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation failures. In one case, a system used string comparison to check if the hashes match - which worked great until there was a null byte in the hash (which is also used to indicate the end of a string in memory). This allowed attackers to steal a valid signature, with only a partial hash collision.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploitable code. If the signature check cannot be defeated, and I’ve had to do this, there are often ways to bypass it completely by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in poorly-written code.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Slide 13:</strong> (Brandon) To take advantage of all of these possibilities, an attacker has to perform some significant reverse engineering. Most of the products that are likely to be targeted, have little or no documentation - there are no spec sheets, no SDKs. It requires reverse engineering the firmware, and using that to document and understand how the hardware works, and then use that to identify how to add or change functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 14:</strong> (Brandon) On thumbdrives, being able to update firmware opens the doors to many things, not just the composite device attacks, but also changes in device behavior that makes it all but impossible to know if the device is behaving in a trustworthy way.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 15:</strong> (Brandon) Thumbdrives are often used to transport sensitive information - but with modified firmware, it might not be doing what you think it is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicating data to a hidden area for later retrieval</li>
<li>Instead of deleting files, copying it to a hidden area</li>
<li>Altering file contents when written - imagine writing a document to a drive, and later opening it to find that it says something else?</li>
<li>Inserting malware into executables. The first time an executable is read (by antivirus software), it appears legitimate, but the second time it’s read (for execution), it’s completely different.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can see where we are going here - once you can no longer trust the firmware of a device, you can&#8217;t trust that anything it does or tells you.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 16:</strong> (Brandon) A drive could also be modified to defeat forensic analysis. It&#8217;s common to connect a thumbdrive to a write-blocker to protect it - but a write-blocker can&#8217;t protect against the firmware.</p>

<p>Something we designed, but aren&#8217;t releasing, is modified firmware that expects to receive a special command from the PC it&#8217;s connected to - if that command isn&#8217;t received within the first few seconds, it then proceeds to erase the NAND, and destroy the firmware. Rendering the device unusable.</p>

<p>Within seconds of connecting it to a machine that doesn&#8217;t pass the secret command, the drive is toast. With this type of firmware, the only way to dump the data safely becomes dumping the NAND directly, without allowing the controller to have power. And by protecting the NAND by coating it in a hard substance like epoxy, even dumping the NAND becomes problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 17:</strong> (Brandon) So, with all of that said - let&#8217;s take a look at BadUSB in action, with some of the code that we&#8217;ve made publicly available. After we see it in action, we&#8217;ll talk about where this research can go, and try to help you understand what the real risks are.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 18:</strong> (Brandon) This first demo is just the classic “show up as a keyboard and type out a bunch of commands automatically” scenario, which has been in the wild for many years through other devices such as the USB Rubber Ducky device, development boards, etc.</p>

<p>What this drive will do is type out a one-line PowerShell command that downloads an executable from a server and executes it. This executable will open a shell so others can connect and do various bad things.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 19:</strong> (Brandon) Next up, we&#8217;ll show you a patch to the existing firmware to add a new feature for data exfiltration - a hidden partition that&#8217;s only accessible via the right events.</p>

<p>The drive is divided in half, the first half of the drive shows up when you insert the device - if you look at it in &#8220;Disk Management&#8221; in Windows, you&#8217;ll only see half the size, format it - half the size, query the device - same thing, half the size. Everything looks and acts normal. Format it, do whatever you want. This is hidden entirely in firmware, so the host device doesn&#8217;t have a way to see what&#8217;s going on unless the right bit is flipped.</p>

<p>Until you eject the drive - not using the &#8220;safely remove hardware&#8217; option, but eject - after a few seconds it&#8217;ll re-enumerate and mount a hidden partition. You can dump whatever data you like here, and either unplug the drive, or hit eject again to get back to the first, original partition a few seconds later.</p>

<p>This is a really simple way to hide data on a drive that appears to be empty. I wouldn&#8217;t try to use it to get past the NSA, but it&#8217;ll pass most checks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 20:</strong> (Brandon) Many drives support a mode that allows the contents to be protected by a user supplied password - until you enter the password, you can&#8217;t see the content of the drive.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made a very simple patch to the firmware that changes the way that the password change function works.</p>

<p>Normally you wouldn&#8217;t be able to access the contents of the drive without knowing the user&#8217;s password. With a simple change, we can change the password change function, so that it doesn&#8217;t verify that the old password is right - so you can take a drive that has password protected content, apply our patch, and change the password to something you know, without ever knowing the original password.</p>

<p>This shows how a simple change in unsigned firmware can drastically change the security profile of the device.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ll take a drive, where I don&#8217;t know the password, and set the password to something new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 21:</strong> (Brandon) – Here’s Adam to talk about where this research can go, and the implications and impacts of BadUSB.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 22:</strong> (Adam) So far, all we&#8217;ve been talking about is thumbdrives - but that&#8217;s just the beginning. How many people here knew that some keyboards and mice have user updateable firmware?</p>

<p>In 2009, K. Chen demonstrated an attack against Apple keyboards, it used the same technique behind BadUSB. Update the device with malicious firmware, have it open a reverse shell, win.</p>

<p>This was from 2009, and what we are seeing with BadUSB is just another take on the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 23:</strong> (Adam) This issue isn&#8217;t unique to thumb drives - many different devices are subject to the same issues. So many devices that are routinely and thoughtlessly connected to computers can be updated with malicious firmware.</p>

<p>Even better - many of these devices are installed in laptops, and connect over USB internally. So it&#8217;s possible that even internal peripherals could be attacked. The USB hubs integrated into motherboards are even a risk.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t say this to make you paranoid, but so you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of your attack surface. These devices are all around us, and any time one of them isn&#8217;t in our control, it could be reprogrammed by an attacker.</p>

<p>Keyboards, mice, printers, webcams, touchpads, Bluetooth adapters, SD card readers, USB hubs - almost anything that connects over USB could be attacked this way. The problem is, nobody knows what is vulnerable.</p>

<p>Devices aren&#8217;t labeled with what controller they use, and even for the same brand and model of a device, the controller used can vary. This makes it nearly impossible to determine what is and isn&#8217;t at risk to this type of attack.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 24:</strong> (Adam) Shortly after we released our code, I got a call from a reporter at Wired asking for more information. One of the topics that came up is, could this be used to build a firmware based worm.</p>

<p>After the question was asked, I sat in silence for a moment before responding - this is not only something we had thought of, but Brandon and I had spent hours discussing the possibility. At first, it was because we thought it could be the basis of a great talk - but then, it turned into a discussion of risks, was such research too risky.</p>

<p>I finally answered - yes, it&#8217;s possible, and we know how to do it.</p>

<p>This is the worst case scenario for BadUSB, a worm that infects the firmware of thumbdrives, and possibly other devices. Plugging an infected device into a machine could be enough to infect it, then it will spread from machine, to devices, to other machines. The devices could be made to be nearly impossible to clean - format the thumbdrives all you want, that won&#8217;t get rid of malware in the firmware. This is a scenario we hope to never be seen in the wild, but with an attacker with enough resources, it&#8217;s very possible.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 25:</strong> (Adam) This is clearly a problem, and very much a risk, on multiple fronts for secure environments - so how is this being addressed? For the most part, it isn&#8217;t. For me, there&#8217;s a striking similarity between the way these manufacturers are reacting to this, and the way ICS manufacturers responded to security issues prior to Stuxnet. They ignored the problem until something so dramatic, so important happened, that they couldn&#8217;t ignore it any longer.</p>

<p>I expect it&#8217;ll be the same with BadUSB - at some point there will be an event that drives the point home that this issue has to be addressed at the root of the problem - the massive number of devices with insecure firmware updates.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 26:</strong> (Adam) As Brandon said earlier, to pull of any of these attacks requires some significant reverse engineering work - if you have the right experience, it&#8217;s really not that hard. It does take quite a bit of time though. So, these are practical attacks, but there aren&#8217;t that many people that can do the work.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 27:</strong> (Adam) This is one of the most common questions, and the hardest to answer. Some of these attacks can be more easily performed with other hardware - the pre-programmed keyboard that opens a shell for example, can be done with a USB Rubber Ducky, an easy to acquire pen-testing tool that looks just like a thumbdrive, but is actually much more.</p>

<p>With USB development boards readily available, many things that are possible with BadUSB, are easier with better understood, well documented hardware. So, if an employee plugging in an unknown thumbdrive and it turning into a keyboard is a real risk in your environment - then BadUSB isn&#8217;t the problem you should be worried about.</p>

<p>Now, things like the integrity of data on the device, the modifications to how a thumbdrive operates, that&#8217;s a different issue, and one that&#8217;s harder to protect against. If the drive is ever out of your control, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s trustable. I hate FUD as much as anyone, but if you have a device that anyone can update to operate in ways that you don&#8217;t want - if you ever lose control of it, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s working for you or an attacker.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the risk? It depends on how much people want what you have.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 28:</strong> (Adam) How many people here have policies that allow employees to use their own keyboard or mouse? OK, how many people think this happens even if it&#8217;s against policy?</p>

<p>When most people talk about BYOD policies, they aren&#8217;t thinking about the devices that connect to computers. But thanks to BadUSB, this is something that all companies should be thinking about - a user bringing in that Razer mouse they love so much, could actually be introducing a new attack vector, thanks to the updateable firmware.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to recommend that companies ban all outside devices - but companies should be very aware of not just what&#8217;s on their network, but what&#8217;s connected to the things on their network. You can&#8217;t protect against what you don&#8217;t know about.</p>
