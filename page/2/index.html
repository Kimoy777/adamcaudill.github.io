  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/islamic_mo_full/"><img class="center" src="/files/muhammad.jpg"></a></p>

<p>When I was a teenager I worked as a photojournalist and through that experience I learned just how important it is that the public, and the press in particular be able to speak openly, freely, and without restriction.</p>

<p>I also learned how important discretion is — I routinely worked events where people died, those people had families and they would see the photographs that documented the end of a life. Photos chosen for publishing had to be carefully picked, making the wrong choice could offend some, and truly hurt others. I saw people break down and cry when seeing photos I took — I saw the results of brash carelessness on families that were already hurting, already devastated.</p>

<p>I once was tasked with documenting a hate crime — a black effigy hung from a tree, followed shortly thereafter by a body found in a river — hands bound, and clearly related. People were scared, the mock hanging was a warning, and the body found proved that the threat was real. What gets shown and what doesn’t in cases like this is a very difficult choice. On one hand you risk offended and inciting fear — maybe even panic, on the other, you withhold useful information, stifle discussion, and risk leaving the truth sitting in a box, hidden from the world.</p>

<p>For all of the bad, there was also good — lives changed, hard questions asked, reforms enacted, true change made. This wasn’t done without stepping on toes though, hard decisions had to be made to find the right balance.</p>

<p>Making people comfortable is easy — give them what they want and no more. To make people think though, requires making them uncomfortable, requires pushing them outside of their comfort zone — and occasionally, offending them.</p>

<h2>The attack on Charlie Hebdo</h2>

<p>I firmly believe that journalism, legitimate journalism, is among the most critical tasks in a free society. Shining a light on the good and the bad — the eyes and ears of the people, too often the last chance for justice. When questions can’t be asked, when public figures are put beyond satire and debate, when some topics are unquestionably untouchable, then freedom dies. Slowly at first, then the line inches ever forward until the press is nothing but a mouthpiece for their puppet masters and feeding the public little more than entertainment - no challenges, no discomfort, no thought required entertainment.</p>

<p>Charlie Hebdo made a habit of making people uncomfortable — they attacked everyone and everything in power, they left nothing untouched. In doing so they offended almost everyone — some got mad and stomped away; others took it as a chance to reflect, not  only on the statement, but their own reactions, feelings, and beliefs; a few though decided that they needed to die for it.</p>

<p>Those at Charlie Hebdo worked despite threats and attacks, they continued in the face of danger. Every issue published was an act of bravery — sometimes tasteless, sometimes wantonly offensive, but still an act of bravery.</p>

<p>In a effort to silence the criticism of their preferred historical figure, a small group following an extreme and radical interpretation of a religion, took it upon themselves to silence journalists and artists by force. The goal though, went far beyond Charlie Hebdo — the attack was meant to send a wave of fear and terror throughout the world and leave journalists too afraid to say anything or risk a similar fate.</p>

<p>In the hours after the attack, there were clear indications that the extremists that sought to censor the world, may have actually <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/07/charlie-hebdo-censorship-cartoons_n_6431854.html">achieved that goal</a>. Publications around the world censored the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo, an act I consider to be cowardice, and willing, knowing capitulation. In the face of danger, some will choose to be brave and stand for what they believe — others will abandon what they believe readily when faced with the threat, or even the idea of danger.</p>

<p>Nothing is beyond ridicule, no person above satire — not political leaders, not Muhammad, not Jesus, not Zoroaster, not Zeus, not Ra, not Utu.</p>

<h2>#JeSuisCharlie</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/">Robert Graham</a> posted an <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/552862494684094464">image on Twitter</a> that immediately gave me mixed feelings; I agreed and disagreed all at the same time. On one hand, the image is the very definition of satire — it’s a strong point on the perception that these religious extremists are leaving many with. On the other hand, it could further inflame the situation,  insulting some and adding more energy to those that have shown they will not be subject to rational thought. It was also an act of defiance, a statement that he would not be censored, and a recommendation that others should follow his example and show that the world will not allow a group of extremists to define what’s acceptable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/files/jesuischarlie.png" width="299" height="338"></p>

<p>For those that are offended by this image, I’m sorry that you feel as you do — though I will offer no apology for posting it. Offending for the sake of offense should be avoided — and is an act I disagree with, offending for the sake of making a point though, is sometimes necessary.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>I rarely agree with H. Nasrallah but yes: &quot;Islamic extremists who slaughter people have done more harm to Islam than anyone else in history&quot;</p>&mdash; Karin Kosina (@kyrah) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyrah/status/553991337750827008">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>The point here is clear — irrational extremists are acting in unimaginable violence against those that they disagree with, and in doing so, branding the religion as one of violence and hate. This is a fact that everyone needs to understand.</p>

<h2>Religious Violence</h2>

<p>Violence and religion have went hand in hand throughout recorded history. Christianity has <em>mostly</em> moved away from violence and many of its ancient prejudices (though certainly not all) — something Islam is still struggling with, based on the extreme views and actions of not only terrorist organizations, but governments.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crowd shouted “Allahu akhbar” as Raif Badawi received 50 lashes for the crime of writing words. 950 more to come&#10;<a href="http://t.co/RRh97uaucT">http://t.co/RRh97uaucT</a></p>&mdash; Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/553816128758501376">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>While extremists have done much to harm Islam, there seems to be a pervasive penchant for violence among the more ‘conservative’ Islamic countries — this acceptance of violence and frequent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/world/middleeast/16saudi.html?_r=0">perversions of justice</a> have also done much to make the world question the Islamic commitment to peace.</p>

<p>For me, as an atheist, knowing that there are thirteen Islamic countries where I could be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE9B900G20131210">put to death</a> for my lack of faith certainly makes me question just how much peace factors into Islamic views.</p>

<p>While most Muslims are peaceful, the large numbers that espouse peace through forced conformity and violence taint the view of the entire religion.</p>

<h2>Freedom from Offense</h2>

<p>One of the most bizarre and damaging perversions on the innate right to free speech, is that there is an implied inverse right to <em>not</em> be exposed to anything offensive. Yet this fictitious right to not be offended is antithetical to freedom of speech - you can have only one of the two.</p>

<p>A right to not be offended is a personal right that would trump the rights of all others — freedom of speech does not imply that anyone must listen, only that you have the right to speak. A right to not be offended would require others to not speak if you didn’t like what they had to say. Such a right is a logical impossibility — if we accept that there is truly an innate right to free speech, then there is no overriding inverse.</p>

<p>So the reality is simple — there are times to preserve the critical and innate right to free speech, that some will be offended.</p>

<p>One challenge for a journalist is to effectivly get a message across that challenges without offending more than absolutely necessary. I can’t say if Charlie Hebdo crossed that line, but even if they did, they were within their rights.</p>

<h2>All Speech Has Value</h2>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>All speech, even the extremely stupid stuff, is valuable. I probably wouldn&#39;t understand evolution were it not for the insane creationists.</p>&mdash; Taylor Hornby (@DefuseSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefuseSec/status/554541092264108034">January 12, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>One final note, inspired by a friend, is that all speech — from the inane and ignorant to true hate speech can have some value. It provides insight, understanding, and perspective that would be missed otherwise.</p>

<p>For those that don’t share perspective with the speaker, such speech that many consider worthless can be a learning experience. You may never agree with them, but at least you can better understand them, and that may lead to clarity.</p>

<p>Embrace the speech that you disagree with and better understand the people behind a perspective that is new to you — it’s a chance to expand you mind, and maybe even bridge a gap and create new understanding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometime in the 1990’s I used a 2400-baud modem and connected to the internet for the first time; I found a new world, a better world. A world where ideas and intellect set people apart, not skin color, or political affiliation, of even the pseudo-scandal of the day (which is probably just a disguise for ignorance and intolerance).</p>

<p>It was a time of invention, in a world where everything was new and the potential was unlimited. It was magic - not the fake Hollywood magic, but real, life changing, nothing can hold you back magic. The only real restriction was your own mind (and maybe your long-distance bill).</p>

<p>Before too long I ran across a short essay that reinforced my view of the internet, and my philosophy towards people in general - <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>. While it resonated with me at the time, as it reflected my life so well, it was one small passage that really mattered to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias&#8230; and you call us criminals.</p><footer><strong>Loyd Blankenship</strong> <cite>The Conscience of a Hacker</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>One simple line, yet such a profound statement. The internet I grew to love was a different world — national borders meant nothing, the freedom to speak your mind was simply assumed for all without question. Governments didn’t understand it well enough to care, and so it was ignored. A different kind of society was allowed to evolve — a society that valued people and intelligence greater than political or religious affiliation. A society where anyone, even a poor kid from the middle of nowhere could have a real impact on the world.</p>

<p>There was of course conflict, and egos, and the ever increasing encroachment of money that would change everything; but in general, it was good — better than any nation I was aware of.</p>

<h2>Utopia Lost</h2>

<p>Today, Solar Designer was commenting on Intel <a href="https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551496338995937280">shutting down</a> certain Russian-language content due to a rather <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russian-blogger-law-puts-new-restrictions-on-internet-freedoms/2014/07/31/42a05924-a931-459f-acd2-6d08598c375b_story.html">horrible Russian law</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people and most countries are their own worst enemies…</p><footer><strong>Solar Designer</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551498166366142465'>twitter.com/solardiz/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>From the early, government ignored days of the internet, certain rights were assumed for all users — it was never written, but at the time it seemed that the internet was beyond any one government. It belonged to humanity, it was for the people. Of course, looking at the history of the internet, this is somewhat amusing, but it’s the way many felt, and it seems many still do.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech, freedom to speak anonymously, and so many others were granted by the internet to people that in the past had never had them. This great invention, this great network of people, had become the greatest tool of equality ever. Such things seem doomed.</p>

<p>As Solar pointed out - countries are their own worst enemies - in this case a horrible law is not only impacting the freedom of speech, but also to avoid the complications it introduces (and other similar laws recently enacted), companies are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-pulls-out-of-russia-2014-12">pulling out of Russia</a> or disabling functionality for Russian users. So the Russian people lose, the economy is impacted, everybody loses something when such mistakes are made.</p>

<p>Of course, this is far from a unique case — the old internet, the free, open, good for humanity internet is all but dead. It’s been a long time since governments discovered what they had ignored for so long, and that an international bastion of freedom had formed under their noses.</p>

<p>Censorship becomes more pervasive every day, the monitoring by the FIVE EYES countries - and who knows who else - is so pervasive that one has to now assume that anything not (securely) encrypted is being seen and analyzed by many. Malware vendors grow rich, by leveraging the greatest invention in human history as a tool for repression and even death. In Russia, exercising an innate human right can <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045">send you to prison</a>, in Syria, <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/syrian-video-blogger-reportedly-killed-in-homs-as-shelling-continues/?_r=0">it can get you killed</a>.</p>

<p>Complacency, subterfuge, infighting, and carelessness have allowed those with power and money to take more more control than they ever should have. Groups like the MPAA are still busy pushing bad laws, trade treaty negotiations continue to risk further censorship, and anti-terror laws are increasingly being aimed at online speech instead of legitimate threats.</p>

<p>The internet I fell in love with was a bastion of freedom. May it long be defended, even if all that’s left is the memory, and the idea of what it could again become.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by a post from <a href="https://scott.arciszewski.me/blog/2014/12/year-2014-reflection">Scott Arciszewski</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and publish a year in review post. This is something that I&#8217;ve generally avoided in the past, as the tone of these posts is more often than not, just cynicism and negativity. After seeing Scott’s post, it made me think about how such a review can be used to send a positive message — something desperately needed.</p>

<p>Year after year, we see predictions, projections, and sales pitches — and the cynical responses that they always generate. It&#8217;s so easy to spend time rolling our eyes at vendors and media, instead of looking forward to ways to improve the situation and make the world a better place — even if only in a tiny way. We may not be able to fix the stupid, but we can at least reduce the damage that it does.</p>

<h2>2014 In Review</h2>

<p>So, without further ado, a personal look back at 2014.</p>

<h3>Security Research &amp; Related</h3>

<p>Overall this has been a very busy year, and I’ve not been able to publish as much as I’d like. In total, I requested only a single CVE for the entire year - <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2890">CVE-2014-2890</a> (I don’t keep a count of how many security related tickets I open, so no idea how many issues I actually reported).</p>

<p>Most of my time was instead spent on a couple projects - <a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson</a> (BadUSB firmware). I’ll talk more about these later.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to spend as much time on public application security work as I had intended, but I did get some reports in, some advice given, some progress made.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>

<p>In 2014 I was fortunate to be asked to speak on a few occasions. When preparing for a talk, I always have mixed emotions — on one hand, it&#8217;s always been a great experience, a chance to meet new people, share knowledge, and hopefully contribute to the community. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a significant amount of time that is lost — and time is without a doubt my most limited resource.</p>

<p>Whether it makes sense or not, I generally don&#8217;t give he same talk twice — especially if the event is recorded. So for each talk, it&#8217;s a real time &amp; energy commitment. I very much hope that those that have seen my talks appreciated them, and got something out of them.</p>

<p>Here is some information from selected talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/08/16/smimp-at-the-defcon-cryptovillage/">SMIMP at the DEFCON Crypto Village</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">Making BadUSB Work For You - DerbyCon</a> (YouTube video now over 100,000 views!)</li>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/11/23/speaking-at-sc-magazine-congress/">Speaking at SC Magazine Congress</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>Personally, this has been a particularly trying year for me, for various reasons. I have, as I always do, made a real effort to not show what&#8217;s going on when things go wrong. So, for all my friends, and everyone else for that matter — if there were times I was distant or difficult, or evasive — I am truly sorry.</p>

<p>With that said, the year could have been far worse, and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for all the friends I have — old and new. It was a busy year, with much going on and never enough time to make everything that needed to happen, actually happen.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>During the year, much of my time was taken up by a couple projects — here is where they stand today:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a></strong> - Without a doubt the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve worked on, with a goal no less than replacing email itself. The first public draft was released in late July — and unfortunately remains basically untouched since then.</p>

<p>Shortly before I released the first public draft, a start-up tried to acquire the rights, so they could develop it, and build there own applications around it. By the time that I told them that I was more interested in making the specification public, they had offered me a position as co-founder in exchange for it.</p>

<p>This project took a substantial amount of time to get to a first draft — and really, it isn&#8217;t complete yet. Given the original goal of the project, leaving it with open issues really doesn’t bother me — that many more points to talk about.</p>

<p>The original plan for the effort was to spur discussion, to get people talking about how email could be replaced. To be secure, a system must be designed with certain goals and threats in mind - something that didn&#8217;t happen with email as we know it today. So to fix email, we need to replace it. SMIMP may not be the answer, but we need to do something.</p>

<p>Overall, though there was some positive feedback, I consider the project to be a failure. I&#8217;m proud of the work I did on it, but it didn&#8217;t have the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson (BadUSB Firmware)</a></strong> - Without a doubt the work that had the most people talking. It was a fun project, we managed to get some code in the hands of those that wanted to extend it.</p>

<p>It’s over, and I’m glad it’s over.</p>

<p><strong>Blog</strong> - This blog has also been a bit less active than I hoped — 16 posts with a total of 18,040 words. I’m pretty sure last year I said I’d blog more. Oops.</p>

<p><strong>My First Novel</strong> - A couple years ago I started occasionally working on an idea for a novel, this year, I set aside what I had been doing, and started fresh (but still based on the same material). My goal was to finish it this year, by there simply wasn&#8217;t enough time.</p>

<p>Writing is something that I have yet to determine if I&#8217;m actually good at - or if I just limp along enough for others to tolerate. While I could write a technical book with confidence, writing fiction is something that, quite intentionally, pushes what I&#8217;m comfortable with.</p>

<p>Making the time and finding the focus for something like this is certainly more difficult than I had imagined. I&#8217;ve come to understand why so many writers drink.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I have to say, I love the communities that I work with. I love that I get to deal with challenging problems. I love that I get to find solutions and make them work. But most of all, I’m thankfully for so many friends and great people that make this work truly enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Looking forward to 2015</h2>

<p>I have a number of goals for 2015, a number of projects that need my attention, and ideas to make the world just a little bit better.</p>

<ul>
<li>SMIMP - While I feel that the project generally failed, there doesn’t seem to be much movement in the let’s-kill-email space, so I don’t think it’s dead quite yet. There just might be another chance to get people talking about a real solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/CurveLock">CurveLock</a> - An open source, secure, modern encryption application. This is mainly an experiment - but the goal is to provide high security, in a simple, easy to use application. Hopefully will get a beta out before too long.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EncryptingCamera/encryptingcamera-spec">EncryptingCamera</a> - Prompted by a conversation on Twitter, a few people got together to make a new application that will hopefully protect a few reporters — and others that need to take photos, and secure them from inspection.</li>
<li>Blog - Last time that I promised to blog more often, I didn’t post again for months, so I’m hoping that I don’t repeat that this time. But I promise to write more, and do my best to keep the content interesting.</li>
<li>Personal Transparency - I’ve always been very concerned with my professional image, and as such tend to keep many details of my life to myself. One personal goal for this year is to be <em>just a bit</em> more open and transparent.</li>
<li>Novel - I intend to have either a deal signed with a publisher, or to publish as an ebook on Amazon before the end of 2015. One way or the other, I’ll be done with it by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Research - I plan on spending more time evaluation open source applications for security issues. In just a few hours a week, can have a real impact on making applications and users more secure.</li>
<li>Open Source Security Tools - I hope to dedicate a reasonable amount of time on new and existing tools to make users more secure, especially when it comes to secure communication. PGP/GPG hasn’t aged well - tools like <a href="https://github.com/tedu/reop">reop</a> have a lot of technical potential, but usability still needs to be improved.</li>
<li>More time outside of the echo chamber - It’s easy to stay inside of the echo chamber, agreeing with ourselves (or disagreeing), but what good does it really do? To have a real impact, we need to spend more time influencing the people that need our help the most.</li>
<li>Consume less, create more - In general, consume less and create more — time is a precious and limited resource, should be used to do as much good as possible.</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh, and one final note for next year - my wife and I are expecting again. Should be an exciting year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[Note: This is satire / fiction; well, more or less - probably more more than less. Any resemblance to real companies, living or dead, is purely coincidental.]</em></p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C — Unnamed White House officials that spoke on the condition of anonymity, have stated that a major American company has been hacked, and the attackers are threatening to release terabytes of proprietary information. The name of the company has not been released at this time.</p>

<p>The officials say that the attack came from a state-sponsored attacker — the speed at which the attackers gained control of the company’s network, the focus on administrative credentials, and the sophistication of the previously unseen malware used in the attack. Based on IP addresses used, the attack has been tied to Belize.</p>

<p>Security researchers from Mendyant Security are working a new report, to be released next week. They have dubbed this new group APT3.14159 - and have identified prior attacks that share similarities with the new attack revealed today. They have identified the attackers as Unit 26478 of the Belize Defense Force.</p>

<p>Officials from the Belize Defense Force refused to comment on this story.</p>

<hr />

<p>“I just talked to the CEO, he wants hourly updates on our findings. Now that the FBI, and Mendyant Security is involved, he wants to know, real time, what’s going on and what we’ve found” said Bob, the middle-age middle-manager that had no experience with security, but accepted the position because it paid more.</p>

<p>“Bob, there are three of us, you have three analysts on the team - we are the entire security team, and we’ve been working for two days straight so far. We’ve had to shut down the entire network - even the core switches are down. We can’t access anything, the US data center is in New York, and the secondary in in Japan. We’ve spent the last two days just collecting notes and making sure that everything was shut down. Here’s your update: we know nothing besides that we were hacked.”</p>

<p>Jerry, a tall, slender, over-worked security analyst had spent the last two days trying to contain a massive hack that liked impacted everything inside the company. Having only three analysts that could do anything useful - and multiple managers that wanted constant updates so they would appear useful - the team was exhausted, confused, and unable to do anything at this point.</p>

<p>The attackers had sent company executives screenshots and file listings from the data they had collected, and demanded a ransom or they would release the data and destroy their systems - the executives couldn’t make anything of it, so assumed it wasn’t important. The security team wasn’t made aware of the emails until workstations started dying.</p>

<p>Two hours after the deadline passed, workstations throughout the multinational company started to fail. At first, the local technicians assumed it was just an unusual rash of hardware failures. By 9AM Eastern the next day, over 3,000 machines had been reported offline, with the number impacted climbing rapidly.</p>

<p>Then, finally, someone called the Director of Information Security - but by unfortunate coincidence he was in a meeting until 10AM. When he finally talked to the technicians, the number reported had grown to 5,500 - he immediately called the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. Unfortunately though, she worked in the west coast, and didn’t start her day until noon eastern time. She immediately realized that something very bad was going on, and asked the Manager of Systems Security (Bob), to have his team of analysts look into it. Bob though, though it was an Information Services issue, and directed the issue to the Senior Manager for Systems &amp; Infrastructure. Two hours later, after traversing his chain of command, he determined it was a security issue, and sent it back to the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. By the time it landed back on her desk, at 2PM Eastern, the number on downed workstations was now over 10,000 and 500 servers. She again passed the issue to Bob, and at 3PM the analysts were finally aware that something had happened.</p>

<p>Once the small team of security analysts were finally made aware, they quickly started to do damage control - disabling all connections to the internet, disconnecting the separate physical sites, anything they could think of to limit the spread of whatever this malware is.</p>

<p>One of the analysts quickly pulled an image of one of the local manager’s laptop, and began to analyze it on her personal machine - all the security analysts assumed that their machines would be wiped too, so any serious work was done on their personal laptops. Within an hour she identified an unusual file, that was named similar to a critical Windows file, but wasn’t signed by Microsoft. She uploaded the file to VirusTotal - none of the engines detected it as malicious, nor did their antivirus software of choice. She noticed that it referenced a well known driver used in commercial software to wipe drives before disposing of them - this looked like the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Thanks to her quick work, they were able to get technicians at local sites to begin cleaning up - by then end of the day, only half of their machines had been wiped. Had it not been for her identifying it, all of their Windows workstations and servers would have been wiped.</p>

<p>“Well, what do I tell the CEO Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Tell him there’s nothing more we can do, so we went to bed. We’ll be back tomorrow-ish” - and with that, the entire team (all three of them) walked out the door.</p>

<hr />

<p>Inside a five story brick office building, on the outskirts of San Francisco a team of analysts for Mendyant Security study the limited logs available and the sample of the malware the Sone Corp analyst found.</p>

<p>From looking at the debug information and embedded strings, there were clear signs of Spanish and Kriol - a dialect of Creole that is common in Belize. The mix of languages in the strings and in the file paths led the analysts to conclude that it wasn’t the work of a single person, but a multilingual team.</p>

<p>The logs indicated that the malware was connecting to China, India, Spain, and Russia. After some initial analysis, all of the Command &amp; Control servers used a particularly old version of a content management system, and were easily hacked. The analysts decided that seeing as these servers were likely hacked, and that the easiest way to gather information from them was to go ahead and hack them and collect whatever information they could.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours, they were downloading full copies of all the data on each of the servers. Once downloaded, they would study the C&amp;C software to see if anything interesting is going on.</p>

<p>The C&amp;C software was written in PHP, and did fairly little on its own - most of the commands were relayed back to a hard-coded  IP on port 31337. The server at that IP was no longer online, so  one of the analysts contacted a security researcher that had been performing internet wide scans, asking if he had any information for that IP. They were lucky, his logs showed that an HTTP server came online on that server a little over six months ago, and disappeared on his last scan, just two days ago.</p>

<p>Looking up the owner of the IP, it was register to the Belize Defense Force. APT3.14159 was born.</p>

<p>The story is clear, hackers for the BDF hacked the C&amp;C servers, having them relay to their own server; once detected, the main server was taken off line.</p>

<hr />

<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. — Today, the FBI revealed that the major corporation attacked by hackers working for Belize, is Sone Corp., a entertainment powerhouse. The stock briefly dropped 5%, but closed the day with a minor increase.</p>

<p>Anonymous source within the government have revealed that they are completely confident that Belize is completely behind this, and other recent attacks. “There will be a price to pay for attacking American businesses - the administration is reviewing the options in response to this clear act of cyber-terrorism” - the source refused to be identified as they weren’t authorized to speak on the subject.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the media in a frenzy, the President was forced to make a statement, formally accusing Belize of attacking not only Sone Corp, but several smaller attacks over the last six months. The tone was harsh, there were promises of severe economic penalties. The United States would not tolerate such attacks.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Six months earlier…</em></p>

<p>In a small bar off of the Las Vegas strip, a small group of pentesters seek refuge from the chaos that is DEF CON. After a few rounds of top-self whiskey, one has a bright idea…</p>

<p>“I’d bet if we spent a few dollars to get a VPS in China, hacked the first military server we can - pull off a few attacks, within a few months we could get the U.S. Government &amp; some of these big security contractors to label us as a nation-state actor.”</p>

<p>“Nah, I’m sure they get the NSA TAO involved to verify before pointing fingers.”</p>

<p>“$1,000 says it’ll work.”</p>

<p>“You’re on.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few hours ago, a Grand Jury in New York decided that the video-taped murder of an unarmed man didn’t justify a trial to determine if those, clearly seen and identified, who killed him had broken any laws. The man I speak of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner">Eric Garner</a>. What struck me immediately, was the Orwellian undertones that this event has.</p>

<h3>Grand Juries &amp; Time Control</h3>

<blockquote><p>He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.</p><footer><strong>George Orwell</strong> <cite>1984</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In criminal cases brought before a Grand Jury to determine if there’s enough evidence that a person is guilty of a crime to justify being charged, the person that controls the past, is the prosecutor. Their responsibility is to present the evidence to the jury - documentation, photos, videos, testimony, etc. - to get them to bring charges, if there is enough to show guilt.</p>

<p>The show isn’t ran by the courts, as is the case with other parts of the justice system, but instead by the prosecutor, who has control over what the jury sees and hears. It is this power, this control over evidence, this control over the past, that allows them to, when they so choose, to take on an alternate role - defender.</p>

<p>In 1985, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler">Sol Wachtler</a>, the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals rather famously mused that a prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to - and based on numbers from the federal grand jury system, that seems very accurate. In 2010, federal grand juries returned indictments in 162,000 cases - and declined to do so in only 11.</p>

<p>For those that are outside of the law enforcement community, it’s clear that the grand jury is just a rubber stamp process. Yet, for those inside the system, its use is more delicate, more finessed - more directed. It’s easy for a prosecutor to get a jury to indict someone - but as recent events have shown, with enough time, they can take undeniable evidence and through careful tactics, sabotage their own case. Preventing the accused from being charged at all.</p>

<p>Suppress useful evidence, call questionable witnesses, present confusing and unclear information, question the integrity of everything presented - there are so many options available to ensure that the jury won’t see clear guilt. With some time, the prosecutor becomes the master of the past, painting the picture that he wants the jury to see - free from disagreement or dissenting views.</p>

<h3>Just a little doublethink…</h3>

<p>How much time, how many confusing statements, how many character assassinations does it take before a jury can see, with their own eyes, a murder - and by the skill of a great <del>defense attorney</del> prosecutor, accept that while they saw a murder, a murder didn’t occur?</p>

<p>Or, in this case, not only didn’t a murder occur - no crime at all occurred. He was murdered, and he wasn’t.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, this wasn’t a open trial - this was simply to determine if charges should be brought at all. In this case, the decision was that there will be no charges, no trial to determine if the killing was justified, no attempt at justice for the dead. Never will a real jury, in a court of law, hear the case and be able to make a determination based on the evidence - that determination was already made by the prosecutor.</p>

<p>A process that is a rubber stamp to those on the outside, becomes a free-pass for those on the inside of the system.</p>

<h3>…and justice for all.</h3>

<p>There is no justice in this case, nor illusion of justice. No thinly veiled farce of a trial to appease the masses. Nothing.</p>

<p>I must wonder, how much longer before such cases won’t even see the “light” of a secret grand jury, and just die on a prosecutors desk. When the prosecutor works to defend the accused - only when the accused is part of their system of course - why bother with the show, why even pretend to try. Justice isn’t their goal, protecting those on the inside, those that enforce is the goal.</p>

<p>Control, intimidation, and fierce reprisal to any that dare resist is the hallmark of enforcement today - “justice” is granted to the favored, retribution to the rest. Enforce and control has become the unspoken replacement to “protect and serve” - a statement that meant little, and now serves as an insult to those, that for one reason or another, find themselves outside of the “favored” group.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crimes committed by LEOs should be prosecuted by a special prosecutor; the risk &amp; impact of them acting as a defense attorney is too great.</p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/status/540249660947181568">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Who enforces against the enforcers? Who can be objective when dealing with a person inside the system that supports them? For any chance at justice, when a member of law enforcement is accused of a crime, it should be an outside prosecutor that brings the case to the grand jury. While there’s still risk of the prosecutor acting more as a defender, by appointing a special prosector from outside the normal system, there’s at least some chance that the grand jury will see the unaltered truth. Then, maybe, there will be a chance for real justice.</p>

<p>Change to the justice system in the United States is needed on many fronts, racism is rampant, intimidation and coercion have become normal, police are more militarized than the military, and the use of excess force is justified by any excuse. Killing a person should be the last, most desperate line of defense - not something excused by the slightest feeling of discomfort. Though as long as the grand jury can so easily act as a free pass, this change will never be achieved.</p>

<p>Things like body cameras, which the federal government is now supporting, are a step in the right direction. They eliminate questions, and allow the public to see, with their own eyes, what happens. But, no matter how many cameras are deployed to monitor law enforcement activity, if grand juries ignore evidence that’s inconvenient to a prosecutor’s goal, no crimes will be averted, no pointless deaths prevented.</p>

<p>The system is broken. Only by a feat of doublethink can anyone see anything else.</p>

<p><em>To my friends in law enforcement:</em> Please don’t take this as an attack against you. You have a hard job, and at times it’s certainly dangerous. But the system is broken, you may think my view is wrong - but your perspective is likely just as tainted. To those on the outside, to those that don’t have the benefit of being protected by the system - too often feel oppressed by the system, punished unfairly and in excess of reason. Please understand that there is a perspective that you, likely, can’t see.</p>
