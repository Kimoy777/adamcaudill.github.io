  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend of mine has been evaluating an open source instant messaging client called <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/">Spark</a>, which can be linked to Active Directory for authentication. Like most IM clients, Spark allows users to save their password - and me being me, I was curious as to how it&#8217;s doing this - as storing Windows domain logins is kinda a big deal.</p>

<p>So, within a few minutes I found all of the details - and none of them make me feel any better. Here are the important bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypted with Triple DES in ECB mode.</li>
<li>IV isn&#8217;t being set.</li>
<li>Encryption key is <strong>hardcoded</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that all users have the same, <a href="http://svn.igniterealtime.org/svn/repos/spark/trunk/src/java/org/jivesoftware/spark/util/Encryptor.java">publicly documented</a> encryption key protecting their password. What&#8217;s the key? It&#8217;s <code>ugfpV1dMC5jyJtqwVAfTpHkxqJ0+E0ae</code> in Base64 encoding - and thanks to this, it&#8217;s trivial to write code to reverse the &#8220;protection&#8221; and make the credentials (which may well be domain credentials) available to anyone with access to the users profile.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s what <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/sparkim-passview">I did</a>. This is simple code that will scan a machine looking for Spark configuration files (named <code>spark.properties</code>) and checks each to see if a password can be extracted. You can also pass in a NetBIOS name, and it will attempt to use the administrative share (C$) to access the profiles on the system. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/sparkim-passview#spark-im-password-decrypter">README</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The saving grace here, is that you have to have access to the user profiles, so if a system is locked down throughly, you likely won&#8217;t make much progress. But if you can get a local administrator account to run this from - it may make a pentest go a little quicker.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to find a way to disable the &#8216;Save Password&#8217; feature, but it seems that the only option was to <a href="http://community.igniterealtime.org/thread/37785">patch the source</a>. If you are using Spark within your environment, I strongly recommend that you carefully consider how it&#8217;s used and integrated with AD or other systems.</p>

<p>Earlier today a group called &#8221;<a href="https://d33ds.co/">D33Ds Company</a>&#8221; released a large (17MB) <a href="https://d33ds.co/archive/yahoo-disclosure.txt">dump</a> from a Yahoo server. The dump includes information from a MySQL database, and the email addresses and passwords from over 450k users. Based on some of the emails and the naming of the tables, I suspect that the data is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Content">Associated Content</a> - a company that Yahoo bought in 2010, and closed in 2011 -  replacing it with <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Voices</a>.</p>

<p>The group that released the dump &#8220;censored&#8221; the name of the server in question, but they neglected to clear the HOSTNAME field in the MySQL information, exposing the server name: dbb1.ac.bf1.yahoo.com</p>

<p>The news that Julian Assange has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/19/world/europe/ecuador-assange-asylum/index.html">asked Ecuador</a> for political asylum is flooding twitter as his supporters do their best to attract attention to his cause, and rally everyone they can to contact Ecuador&#8217;s embassy in London to urge them to grant Assange&#8217;s request. While I&#8217;ve watched the Assange case since before the first allegations came out of Sweden - that&#8217;s not my interest here, my interest is in what Ecuador <em>could</em> do if they wanted to.</p>

<h3>Building a cyber-army</h3>

<p>Ecuador has an interesting problem right now, they can offer to help Assange - which will certainly draw the ire of the US and its closest allies, or they can do nothing - and possibly lose a chance at building a new army. Let me explain&#8230;</p>

<p>The governments of the US and other large powers are spending a lot of money to recruit and train what the press has dubbed &#8216;cyber-warriors&#8217; (i.e. hackers) to perform offensive operations. For smaller countries - throwing a huge budget at something like this just isn&#8217;t possible, but they do have another option. If a country was to offer safe harbor to those at risk of being prosecuted for hacking and related crimes in exchange for assisting their military - they could define a new form of super-power.</p>

<p>The US and UK  both make a habit of throwing their best hackers in prison - if Ecuador helps Assange, it could set the stage for them to help others accused of similar crimes in the future. If they are smart about who they help - they could easily build an army of hackers, an army that could set a new standard for power and control of the technology that we are so dependant on.</p>

<p>(Yes, I realize that Assange isn&#8217;t a hacker himself, but he has a loyal following of those that are - and the action would set the precedent making this possible.)</p>

<p>Wether it will be Ecuador today, or some other small state later I don&#8217;t know - but I&#8217;m willing to bet money that it will happen.</p>

<h3>The future of war</h3>

<p>War has evolved in interesting ways - from arrows, to guns, then to bombs - but the next step is clear: the electron. War (and the power to make war, which I would argue is what&#8217;s really important) will be more about espionage and sabotage than it&#8217;s ever been before. Power grids, banks, communications, and industrial systems will all be targets - and the ability to manipulate these systems will define who the real super powers are.</p>

<p>Imagine the impact to the economy should one of the stock exchanges be attacked, and fake trades generated to drive the price of stocks down. Would we see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">crash of 1929</a> again?</p>

<p>There are also far more subtle attacks that could be perpetrated against a countries ability to make war. Changing technical drawings for example, that could cause a breakdown in a supply chain rendering supplies and equipment useless (e.g. guns bored wrong, missiles wired improperly). Something as simple as changing the quantity or product code on a military order could prevent operations due to a lack of necessary supplies. It&#8217;s attacks like these that would likely target less secure, lower priority systems, that would cause the most chaos.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens next, whatever it is - it&#8217;s sure to have repercussions for years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update 2:</strong> The Snapchat API has changed to address the issues I pointed out to them - and the new API has issues as well. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/12/31/revisiting-snapchat-api-and-security/">posted an update</a> that covers some of these changes.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I heard back from one of the co-founders, he said that they&#8217;d be updating the application to address this in the &#8220;very near future.&#8221; I have to applaud them for the great way they handled this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snapchat.me/">Snapchat</a> was recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/08/snapchat-110-million/">featured</a> on TechCrunch, pointing out that they are expanding to Android and that they&#8217;ve now handled over 110M pictures. So when I see something about an application that auto-deletes messages after they are viewed - I did the only natural thing: dig in and see if it really is secure.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/06/10/monitor-iphone-http-s-traffic-with-fiddler/">monitored</a> the messages being sent back and forth, and mapped out the APIs they use. They have a simple API, which uses both JSON and form-encoding to transfer data. The API itself is fairly clean and easy to understand. Writing a new client against this API is fairly simple - <em>including a client that automatically saves all image received</em>.</p>

<h3>Downloading Images</h3>

<p>The process to download images is pretty simple, it can be as simple as two API calls. The first API needed is <code>ss_auth</code> - the API is used to create sessions. The call to login looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>POST https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/ss_auth HTTP/1.1
Host: feelinsonice.appspot.com
User-Agent: Snapchat 3.0 rv:3.0.0 (iPhone; iPhone OS 5.1.1; en_US)
Content-Length: 32
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: close
Proxy-Connection: close

u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;password&gt;&amp;a=login
</code></pre>

<p>This will return JSON containing couple useful things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The session token, which is required for all other calls.</li>
<li>A list of images that haven&#8217;t been viewed yet (the &#8220;id&#8221; field being the most important).</li>
</ol>


<p>Once the returned JSON is parsed, the rest is just making calls to the <code>blob</code> API - this is the API that actually returns the image data (as a JPG), and can then be saved to disk. The URLs to retrieve an image look like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/blob?u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;session-token&gt;&amp;i=&lt;image-id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This allows images to be easily downloaded, without them being removed.</p>

<h3>How it normally works&#8230;</h3>

<p>In the mobile application, a call to the <code>ss_pa</code> API is made when an image is viewed, this removes the image - and once this is called, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to get the image back.</p>

<pre><code>POST https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/ss_pa HTTP/1.1
Host: feelinsonice.appspot.com
User-Agent: Snapchat 3.0 rv:3.0.0 (iPhone; iPhone OS 5.1.1; en_US)
Content-Length: 102
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: close
Proxy-Connection: close

u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;session-token&gt;&amp;v_str=%7B%22&lt;image-id&gt;%22%3A%22&lt;unix-timestamp&gt;%22%7D
</code></pre>

<p>This API call is the key to keeping the image from being accessed again. If a client didn&#8217;t implement this API, it would allow users to access the images any time they like - completely bypassing the entire point of the application.</p>

<h3>Other APIs</h3>

<p>Here are some of the other APIs used:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ss_refresh</code> - pull the list of images (this API returns a subset of what&#8217;s returned by <code>ss_auth</code>)</li>
<li><code>nsp</code> - uploads an image</li>
<li><code>clear</code> - clears the user&#8217;s history</li>
<li><code>auth</code> - used to destroy the session, not to be confused with <code>ss_auth</code></li>
</ul>


<p>All of these are easily understood and implemented. There are other APIs, for things like registration that I didn&#8217;t look into, as they are beyond the scope of this research.</p>

<h3>Unofficial clients</h3>

<p>With such a simple API I&#8217;d be amazed if other, unofficial, clients didn&#8217;t start turning up - with saving images being their primary feature. A crappy but functional Android client that supports saving could be built in a couple hours.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;m not making any proof-of-concept code available, as I believe that this article makes it sufficiently clear how easy it is to write an unofficial client for this service that allows images to be saved. The goal here isn&#8217;t to exploit this hole, but to point out the risk of untrusted clients.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Session management is fairly well done - and would certainly make unofficial clients that aren&#8217;t full-featured less attractive due to needing to login so often; but this certainly doesn&#8217;t provide any protection. The API itself seems to have no protection against untrusted clients, making it trivial to save images or perform other unintended actions.</p>

<p>I did contact the authors to suggest that they encrypt the image data when it&#8217;s sent to the client, making it harder to get the data without reverse engineering the application. It wouldn&#8217;t stop everyone, but it would make the task less trivial.</p>

<p>Given the nature of the application, I suspect unofficial clients are unavoidable though - especially as the service grows in popularity (as I expect it will once the official Android client is released).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a research project I decided that I needed to monitor the traffic to and from my iPhone - both HTTP and HTTPS. Having had so much luck with Fiddler in the past, it was the first place I looked. There are a number of posts on this topic, but few that provide a clear and complete picture of what&#8217;s needed. So I wrote one.</p>

<p>First, install the latest version of <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/version.asp">Fiddler</a>, then install the iOS-compatible <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/dl/FiddlerCertMaker.exe">certificate generator</a>. Now update the settings to decrypt HTTPS traffic:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1430.png"></p>

<p>Next, update the settings to allow remote connections (make sure that restart Fiddler after this):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1433.png"></p>

<p>Then export the Fiddler Root Certificate to your desktop from the options dialog:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1436.png"></p>

<p>Email the <code>FiddlerRoot.cer</code> file to your iPhone - you&#8217;ll need to import and trust the certificate to make this work. To install certificate, just click on the attachment and click the &#8216;Install&#8217; button.</p>

<p>Now configure your iPhone to use the Fiddler proxy. The setting can be found at Setting -> Wi-Fi -> (your network) -> HTTP Proxy -> Manual. Set the &#8216;Server&#8217; to the IP address of of your PC, then set &#8216;Port&#8217; to 8888, and &#8216;Authentication&#8217; to off.</p>

<p>You should now be able to see all of the HTTP and HTTPS traffic going across your phone. It&#8217;s worth noting though, that some applications won&#8217;t work while using the proxy - Twitter being one, though most work without issue.</p>
