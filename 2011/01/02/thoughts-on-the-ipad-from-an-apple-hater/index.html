<div class="entry-content"><p>Before I get started, let me make a couple of things clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple is evil; pure and simple. I&#8217;m fully convinced that Steve Jobs has weekly planning meetings with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> himself1.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s policies are anti-everybody. From bloggers to developers2, Apple seems to make life as hard as possible for those that use their products for profit.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With these facts in mind, I tend to shy away from their products when I have a choice (which isn&#8217;t always <a href="http://shadowofthebat.com/2010/12/05/buying-a-macbook-from-cowboom-com/">the case</a>); though a while back I decided to buy an iPad for some reason. I&#8217;ve wanted a tablet for quite some time, and despite my hopes of there being a Microsoft-based solution that would do what I needed, there wasn&#8217;t anything announced that had the features I wanted in a price range that I could justify.</p>

<p>When I first powered it up and was met by that familiar instruction to connect to iTunes, I was really questioning the wisdom of buying an Apple product. But, I took a deep breath, installed iTunes and took the plunge.</p>

<p>That was about 3 months ago, and I no longer question the wisdom – it was a great purchase, and has become a key part of how I work. Between my favorite applications (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a>, and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a>), I&#8217;ve been able to streamline my workflow, keep better notes, and keep the information that I need available – no matter when or where I need it.</p>

<p>The device itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology">ingeniously</a>) designed, with Apple&#8217;s typical focus on simplicity first and foremost. It has a ~10-hour battery life ensures that you&#8217;ll make it through the work day (and probably with enough left to do some reading after work); though your PC probably won&#8217;t be able to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060">charge it</a>. The only thing missing from a hardware perspective is a &#8216;back&#8217; button, as I would quite likely use that more than the &#8216;home&#8217; button.</p>

<p>I was quite concerned initially that it would be like so many other devices and gadgets that I&#8217;ve acquired other the years, interesting for a couple of weeks then doomed to spend the rest of its life buried in one of my &#8216;junk&#8217; boxes. Within the first few hours I was sure that wouldn&#8217;t be its fate; far from it. At this point I rarely leave home without it, even if only going shopping. While I do still rely on my Moto DROID for a number of things, I&#8217;ve found that the iPad does a much better job at serving most of the roles my phone was once responsible for.</p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> – it&#8217;s by far my favorite service and I access it from every device I have. Prior to the iPad I often took notes on the DROID to avoid having to use hand-written notes that would need to be transcribed later; thanks to its small screen and tiny keyboard my notes were as terse as I could get them, often missing details I later wished I had. With the large screen and large, better designed keyboard of the iPad, I&#8217;ve found my notes are now clearer and more detailed – exactly what I need them to be.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who bought one shortly after they came out referred to it as a media consumption device, not suited for work or anything serious. While this is what I expected, it&#8217;s not what I found; it&#8217;s a great media player (despite the lack of a 16:9 screen) and thanks to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8">Kindle</a> application, it&#8217;s also a very good e-reader, but with the right applications it has a strong business side as well.</p>

<p>What I feared would be a toy relegated to the abyss of abandoned gadgets has turned into a key tool helping me keep my chaotic life in order.</p>

<p>1Before anybody says anything, yes, this is just a joke.
2While Apple has made a lot of <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/09/apple-opens-app-store-to-other-development-platforms-publishes-review-guidelines/">progress</a> in opening up and making rules more clear, though they could still do better.</p>
