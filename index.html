  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few hours ago, a Grand Jury in New York decided that the video-taped murder of an unarmed man didn’t justify a trial to determine if those, clearly seen and identified, who killed him had broken any laws. The man I speak of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner">Eric Garner</a>. What struck me immediately, was the Orwellian undertones that this event has.</p>

<h3>Grand Juries &amp; Time Control</h3>

<blockquote><p>He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.</p><footer><strong>George Orwell</strong> <cite>1984</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In criminal cases brought before a Grand Jury to determine if there’s enough evidence that a person is guilty of a crime to justify being charged, the person that controls the past, is the prosecutor. Their responsibility is to present the evidence to the jury - documentation, photos, videos, testimony, etc. - to get them to bring charges, if there is enough to show guilt.</p>

<p>The show isn’t ran by the courts, as is the case with other parts of the justice system, but instead by the prosecutor, who has control over what the jury sees and hears. It is this power, this control over evidence, this control over the past, that allows them to, when they so choose, to take on an alternate role - defender.</p>

<p>In 1985, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler">Sol Wachtler</a>, the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals rather famously mused that a prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to - and based on numbers from the federal grand jury system, that seems very accurate. In 2010, federal grand juries returned indictments in 162,000 cases - and declined to do so in only 11.</p>

<p>For those that are outside of the law enforcement community, it’s clear that the grand jury is just a rubber stamp process. Yet, for those inside the system, its use is more delicate, more finessed - more directed. It’s easy for a prosecutor to get a jury to indict someone - but as recent events have shown, with enough time, they can take undeniable evidence and through careful tactics, sabotage their own case. Preventing the accused from being charged at all.</p>

<p>Suppress useful evidence, call questionable witnesses, present confusing and unclear information, question the integrity of everything presented - there are so many options available to ensure that the jury won’t see clear guilt. With some time, the prosecutor becomes the master of the past, painting the picture that he wants the jury to see - free from disagreement or dissenting views.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Grand juries have enormous independence on paper, but almost impossible to exercise in practice. All evidence seen via prosecutor&#39;s lens.</p>&mdash; matt blaze (@mattblaze) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/540238535274418176">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

<h3>Just a little doublethink…</h3>

<p>How much time, how many confusing statements, how many character assassinations does it take before a jury can see, with their own eyes, a murder - and by the skill of a great <del>defense attorney</del> prosecutor, accept that while they saw a murder, a murder didn’t occur?</p>

<p>Or, in this case, not only didn’t a murder occur - no crime at all occurred. He was murdered, and he wasn’t.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, this wasn’t a open trial - this was simply to determine if charges should be brought at all. In this case, the decision was that there will be no charges, no trial to determine if the killing was justified, no attempt at justice for the dead. Never will a real jury, in a court of law, hear the case and be able to make a determination based on the evidence - that determination was already made by the prosecutor.</p>

<p>A process that is a rubber stamp to those on the outside, becomes a free-pass for those on the inside of the system.</p>

<h3>…and justice for all.</h3>

<p>There is no justice in this case, nor illusion of justice. No thinly veiled farce of a trial to appease the masses. Nothing.</p>

<p>I must wonder, how much longer before such cases won’t even see the “light” of a secret grand jury, and just die on a prosecutors desk. When the prosecutor works to defend the accused - only when the accused is part of their system of course - why bother with the show, why even pretend to try. Justice isn’t their goal, protecting those on the inside, those that enforce is the goal.</p>

<p>Control, intimidation, and fierce reprisal to any that dare resist is the hallmark of enforcement today - “justice” is granted to the favored, retribution to the rest. Enforce and control has become the unspoken replacement to “protect and serve” - a statement that meant little, and now serves as an insult to those, that for one reason or another, find themselves outside of the “favored” group.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="350"><p>Crimes committed by LEOs should be prosecuted by a special prosecutor; the risk &amp; impact of them acting as a defense attorney is too great.</p>&mdash; Adam Caudill (@adamcaudill) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcaudill/status/540249660947181568">December 3, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Who enforces against the enforcers? Who can be objective when dealing with a person inside the system that supports them? For any chance at justice, when a member of law enforcement is accused of a crime, it should be an outside prosecutor that brings the case to the grand jury. While there’s still risk of the prosecutor acting more as a defender, by appointing a special prosector from outside the normal system, there’s at least some chance that the grand jury will see the unaltered truth. Then, maybe, there will be a chance for real justice.</p>

<p>Change to the justice system in the United States is needed on many fronts, racism is rampant, intimidation and coercion have become normal, police are more militarized than the military, and the use of excess force is justified by any excuse. Killing a person should be the last, most desperate line of defense - not something excused by the slightest feeling of discomfort. Though as long as the grand jury can so easily act as a free pass, this change will never be achieved.</p>

<p>Things like body cameras, which the federal government is now supporting, are a step in the right direction. They eliminate questions, and allow the public to see, with their own eyes, what happens. But, no matter how many cameras are deployed to monitor law enforcement activity, if grand juries ignore evidence that’s inconvenient to a prosecutor’s goal, no crimes will be averted, no pointless deaths prevented.</p>

<p>The system is broken. Only by a feat of doublethink can anyone see anything else.</p>

<p><em>To my friends in law enforcement:</em> Please don’t take this as an attack against you. You have a hard job, and at times it’s certainly dangerous. But the system is broken, you may think my view is wrong - but your perspective is likely just as tainted. To those on the outside, to those that don’t have the benefit of being protected by the system - too often feel oppressed by the system, punished unfairly and in excess of reason. Please understand that there is a perspective that you, likely, can’t see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week <a href="http://brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave the lunch keynote at the <a href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/link=16">SC Magazine Congress</a> event in Chicago. It was a fun, more executive level event - a big thanks to Eric Green and team. The talk was mostly an executive overview of what was discussed at <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">our DerbyCon talk</a>, with some updates, and some insights.</p>

<p>Here are the slides, and a rough transcript from the event:</p>

<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41900274" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p><em>(This is based on the speaker notes - so it doesn’t include the discussion and other bits that were said)</em></p>

<p><strong>Slide 2:</strong> (Adam) Hi, I&#8217;m Adam Caudill, I&#8217;m here today with Brandon Wilson, and we are here to talk about some research that we&#8217;ve been working on. We will be giving you some background information on BadUSB, showing it to you in action, and talking through the real risks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 3:</strong> (Adam) USB devices are truly ubiquitous - they are all around us. We all use them on a daily basis, but as is true for most technologies, the things that make our lives easier can be turned to attack us. This is a clear case of a technology that was designed to make life easier, but thanks to designers and implementers not fully understanding the potential for abuse, they have opened a door to attack vectors that most people don’t realize exists.</p>

<p>That USB is so common is both a blessing and a curse – from a convenience perspective, it’s great that USB devices and things that support USB are everywhere, but from a security perspective, there are costs, there are risks. Risks that few people realize that they need to be worried about.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 4:</strong> (Adam) BadUSB - the ability to take a seemingly harmless device and turn it into something evil, has been getting a lot of attention lately. We are here to talk about our findings, other research that&#8217;s going on, how this research can be extended, and what it means for those trying to defend against attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 5:</strong> (Adam) First, lets talk about what BadUSB isn&#8217;t - it&#8217;s not an exploit, it&#8217;s arguably not even a vulnerability. It&#8217;s not a flaw in a device, or an oversight in a protocol. BadUSB, really, part behavior by design, and part carelessness on the part of device manufacturers.</p>

<p>BadUSB was first publicized by the Security Research Labs team from Germany, their work started with looking into a way to reprogram thumb drives to perform data processing - this led them to realize that the technique they intended to use to add features, could also be used by attackers.</p>

<p>Their talk at Black Hat USA was the first time many people heard about the possibility for such issues. It&#8217;s their talk, and their decision to limit the details they released, that led us to change directions in some research we were doing, and get more details and code out to defenders.</p>

<p>Before we go too much further, lets talk just a little about USB, things most people don’t know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 6:</strong> (Brandon) When BadUSB was first introduced, the focus was on a design aspect of USB - something that has been used by legitimate designs for years, composite devices. In short, a composite device is a USB device that has multiple interfaces, or profiles, each exposing a different type of device. The classic case for BadUSB is a thumbdrive that is also a keyboard.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a vulnerability though - this is perfectly compliant with the USB specification. Devices are allowed to do this, it&#8217;s intended behavior and by itself is not a bad thing. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t just apply to being a mass storage device and a keyboard - NICs, printers, USB display adapters, webcams, and so on - any combination is possible.</p>

<p>So, for this part at least - it&#8217;s a feature, a feature that can be abused.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 7:</strong> (Brandon) To turn a thumbdrive into something more, it requires updating the device’s firmware - the code that resides on the device and makes it function. Many people see thumbdrives as just a data storage device, without realizing that there&#8217;s a programmable controller inside.</p>

<p>These controllers are often user updatable, meaning that with only some software, anyone can perform the update. Why would the manufacturer want to let people update the firmware on a flash drive, you might ask? Well, there can be bug fixes, improvements to how it communicates with the NAND memory inside, better bad block management, etc. Where this becomes a problem though, is that some of the largest controller vendors don&#8217;t enforce signed updates. So not only can any user update them, they can update them with any code they choose.</p>

<p>So this, the fact that they are selling chips that don&#8217;t have any security considerations at all, is what turns USB&#8217;s feature of allowing composite devices into a real attack vector.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 8:</strong> (Brandon) Using firmware as an attack vector is far from new though, it&#8217;s been done for years - though I don&#8217;t believe that most people realize that so much research has been done that shows how weak many devices are.</p>

<p>We’ll get into some examples a little bit later, but people were reprogramming Apple keyboards to appear as other devices years ago, and a decade ago I was making graphing calculators show up as flash drives, so this is by no means new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 9:</strong> Here is a picture of a typical thumb drive &#8211; there is the USB port of course, then that square controller chip which is the “brain” of the device (and what runs the firmware that makes the drive work), and then the NAND flash memory on the far left.</p>

<p>There are different vendors involved here &#8211; NAND comes from one company, controller from another, sold under another name, etc. They’re essentially just putting the parts together, so there are a lot of different combinations out there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 10:</strong> (Brandon) Let&#8217;s take a few minutes to talk about firmware&#8230;</p>

<p>For this talk, so we can have specific examples, we are going to talk about the Phison family of controllers - Phison is the largest maker of controllers used in thumbdrives, so that&#8217;s why we are picking on them.</p>

<p>In this case, the device has a small boot image built into the controller itself, which is responsible for loading the firmware from the NAND chip and executing it - through the use of special applications on a PC, users can update the firmware with different, or modified versions. This is something most users know nothing about - but it&#8217;s there.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 11:</strong> (Brandon) Devices with updateable firmware aren&#8217;t inherently evil of course, but the question is, does it use signed updates. Which is to say, do the updates include a cryptographic signature, based on a protected private key that only the device manufacturer has access to. If the answer to that is no - the devices doesn&#8217;t validate the origin of updates, and it could be a target for a BadUSB style attack.</p>

<p>To be secure, devices need to validate all updates, using a non-updatable public key. This is the only way to ensure that the firmware is from a legitimate source, and not from some attacker. If the public key were updateable, then there&#8217;s the risk that with physical access, or by taking advantage of a flaw, the key could be changed to an attacker-controlled public key - making it impossible to restore the device to stock firmware.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 12:</strong> (Brandon) Even <em>if</em> a device uses only signed updates, that&#8217;s not a guarantee that it&#8217;s safe. There are many ways that an update system can fail - and it&#8217;s important to remember that once these systems are developed, they tend to not be updated, so they are often using old or even obsolete technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Weak signing keys. Texas Instruments found this out the hard way, when their 512-bit RSA signing keys for their graphing calculator line were factored and publicly released, allowing anyone to release signed updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification failures. There have been some systems that use signing - but never bother to actually validate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation failures. In one case, a system used string comparison to check if the hashes match - which worked great until there was a null byte in the hash (which is also used to indicate the end of a string in memory). This allowed attackers to steal a valid signature, with only a partial hash collision.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploitable code. If the signature check cannot be defeated, and I’ve had to do this, there are often ways to bypass it completely by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in poorly-written code.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Slide 13:</strong> (Brandon) To take advantage of all of these possibilities, an attacker has to perform some significant reverse engineering. Most of the products that are likely to be targeted, have little or no documentation - there are no spec sheets, no SDKs. It requires reverse engineering the firmware, and using that to document and understand how the hardware works, and then use that to identify how to add or change functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 14:</strong> (Brandon) On thumbdrives, being able to update firmware opens the doors to many things, not just the composite device attacks, but also changes in device behavior that makes it all but impossible to know if the device is behaving in a trustworthy way.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 15:</strong> (Brandon) Thumbdrives are often used to transport sensitive information - but with modified firmware, it might not be doing what you think it is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicating data to a hidden area for later retrieval</li>
<li>Instead of deleting files, copying it to a hidden area</li>
<li>Altering file contents when written - imagine writing a document to a drive, and later opening it to find that it says something else?</li>
<li>Inserting malware into executables. The first time an executable is read (by antivirus software), it appears legitimate, but the second time it’s read (for execution), it’s completely different.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can see where we are going here - once you can no longer trust the firmware of a device, you can&#8217;t trust that anything it does or tells you.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 16:</strong> (Brandon) A drive could also be modified to defeat forensic analysis. It&#8217;s common to connect a thumbdrive to a write-blocker to protect it - but a write-blocker can&#8217;t protect against the firmware.</p>

<p>Something we designed, but aren&#8217;t releasing, is modified firmware that expects to receive a special command from the PC it&#8217;s connected to - if that command isn&#8217;t received within the first few seconds, it then proceeds to erase the NAND, and destroy the firmware. Rendering the device unusable.</p>

<p>Within seconds of connecting it to a machine that doesn&#8217;t pass the secret command, the drive is toast. With this type of firmware, the only way to dump the data safely becomes dumping the NAND directly, without allowing the controller to have power. And by protecting the NAND by coating it in a hard substance like epoxy, even dumping the NAND becomes problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 17:</strong> (Brandon) So, with all of that said - let&#8217;s take a look at BadUSB in action, with some of the code that we&#8217;ve made publicly available. After we see it in action, we&#8217;ll talk about where this research can go, and try to help you understand what the real risks are.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 18:</strong> (Brandon) This first demo is just the classic “show up as a keyboard and type out a bunch of commands automatically” scenario, which has been in the wild for many years through other devices such as the USB Rubber Ducky device, development boards, etc.</p>

<p>What this drive will do is type out a one-line PowerShell command that downloads an executable from a server and executes it. This executable will open a shell so others can connect and do various bad things.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 19:</strong> (Brandon) Next up, we&#8217;ll show you a patch to the existing firmware to add a new feature for data exfiltration - a hidden partition that&#8217;s only accessible via the right events.</p>

<p>The drive is divided in half, the first half of the drive shows up when you insert the device - if you look at it in &#8220;Disk Management&#8221; in Windows, you&#8217;ll only see half the size, format it - half the size, query the device - same thing, half the size. Everything looks and acts normal. Format it, do whatever you want. This is hidden entirely in firmware, so the host device doesn&#8217;t have a way to see what&#8217;s going on unless the right bit is flipped.</p>

<p>Until you eject the drive - not using the &#8220;safely remove hardware&#8217; option, but eject - after a few seconds it&#8217;ll re-enumerate and mount a hidden partition. You can dump whatever data you like here, and either unplug the drive, or hit eject again to get back to the first, original partition a few seconds later.</p>

<p>This is a really simple way to hide data on a drive that appears to be empty. I wouldn&#8217;t try to use it to get past the NSA, but it&#8217;ll pass most checks.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 20:</strong> (Brandon) Many drives support a mode that allows the contents to be protected by a user supplied password - until you enter the password, you can&#8217;t see the content of the drive.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made a very simple patch to the firmware that changes the way that the password change function works.</p>

<p>Normally you wouldn&#8217;t be able to access the contents of the drive without knowing the user&#8217;s password. With a simple change, we can change the password change function, so that it doesn&#8217;t verify that the old password is right - so you can take a drive that has password protected content, apply our patch, and change the password to something you know, without ever knowing the original password.</p>

<p>This shows how a simple change in unsigned firmware can drastically change the security profile of the device.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ll take a drive, where I don&#8217;t know the password, and set the password to something new.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 21:</strong> (Brandon) – Here’s Adam to talk about where this research can go, and the implications and impacts of BadUSB.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 22:</strong> (Adam) So far, all we&#8217;ve been talking about is thumbdrives - but that&#8217;s just the beginning. How many people here knew that some keyboards and mice have user updateable firmware?</p>

<p>In 2009, K. Chen demonstrated an attack against Apple keyboards, it used the same technique behind BadUSB. Update the device with malicious firmware, have it open a reverse shell, win.</p>

<p>This was from 2009, and what we are seeing with BadUSB is just another take on the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 23:</strong> (Adam) This issue isn&#8217;t unique to thumb drives - many different devices are subject to the same issues. So many devices that are routinely and thoughtlessly connected to computers can be updated with malicious firmware.</p>

<p>Even better - many of these devices are installed in laptops, and connect over USB internally. So it&#8217;s possible that even internal peripherals could be attacked. The USB hubs integrated into motherboards are even a risk.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t say this to make you paranoid, but so you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of your attack surface. These devices are all around us, and any time one of them isn&#8217;t in our control, it could be reprogrammed by an attacker.</p>

<p>Keyboards, mice, printers, webcams, touchpads, Bluetooth adapters, SD card readers, USB hubs - almost anything that connects over USB could be attacked this way. The problem is, nobody knows what is vulnerable.</p>

<p>Devices aren&#8217;t labeled with what controller they use, and even for the same brand and model of a device, the controller used can vary. This makes it nearly impossible to determine what is and isn&#8217;t at risk to this type of attack.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 24:</strong> (Adam) Shortly after we released our code, I got a call from a reporter at Wired asking for more information. One of the topics that came up is, could this be used to build a firmware based worm.</p>

<p>After the question was asked, I sat in silence for a moment before responding - this is not only something we had thought of, but Brandon and I had spent hours discussing the possibility. At first, it was because we thought it could be the basis of a great talk - but then, it turned into a discussion of risks, was such research too risky.</p>

<p>I finally answered - yes, it&#8217;s possible, and we know how to do it.</p>

<p>This is the worst case scenario for BadUSB, a worm that infects the firmware of thumbdrives, and possibly other devices. Plugging an infected device into a machine could be enough to infect it, then it will spread from machine, to devices, to other machines. The devices could be made to be nearly impossible to clean - format the thumbdrives all you want, that won&#8217;t get rid of malware in the firmware. This is a scenario we hope to never be seen in the wild, but with an attacker with enough resources, it&#8217;s very possible.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 25:</strong> (Adam) This is clearly a problem, and very much a risk, on multiple fronts for secure environments - so how is this being addressed? For the most part, it isn&#8217;t. For me, there&#8217;s a striking similarity between the way these manufacturers are reacting to this, and the way ICS manufacturers responded to security issues prior to Stuxnet. They ignored the problem until something so dramatic, so important happened, that they couldn&#8217;t ignore it any longer.</p>

<p>I expect it&#8217;ll be the same with BadUSB - at some point there will be an event that drives the point home that this issue has to be addressed at the root of the problem - the massive number of devices with insecure firmware updates.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 26:</strong> (Adam) As Brandon said earlier, to pull of any of these attacks requires some significant reverse engineering work - if you have the right experience, it&#8217;s really not that hard. It does take quite a bit of time though. So, these are practical attacks, but there aren&#8217;t that many people that can do the work.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 27:</strong> (Adam) This is one of the most common questions, and the hardest to answer. Some of these attacks can be more easily performed with other hardware - the pre-programmed keyboard that opens a shell for example, can be done with a USB Rubber Ducky, an easy to acquire pen-testing tool that looks just like a thumbdrive, but is actually much more.</p>

<p>With USB development boards readily available, many things that are possible with BadUSB, are easier with better understood, well documented hardware. So, if an employee plugging in an unknown thumbdrive and it turning into a keyboard is a real risk in your environment - then BadUSB isn&#8217;t the problem you should be worried about.</p>

<p>Now, things like the integrity of data on the device, the modifications to how a thumbdrive operates, that&#8217;s a different issue, and one that&#8217;s harder to protect against. If the drive is ever out of your control, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s trustable. I hate FUD as much as anyone, but if you have a device that anyone can update to operate in ways that you don&#8217;t want - if you ever lose control of it, you can&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s working for you or an attacker.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the risk? It depends on how much people want what you have.</p>

<p><strong>Slide 28:</strong> (Adam) How many people here have policies that allow employees to use their own keyboard or mouse? OK, how many people think this happens even if it&#8217;s against policy?</p>

<p>When most people talk about BYOD policies, they aren&#8217;t thinking about the devices that connect to computers. But thanks to BadUSB, this is something that all companies should be thinking about - a user bringing in that Razer mouse they love so much, could actually be introducing a new attack vector, thanks to the updateable firmware.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to recommend that companies ban all outside devices - but companies should be very aware of not just what&#8217;s on their network, but what&#8217;s connected to the things on their network. You can&#8217;t protect against what you don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>For a long time, “military grade encryption” has been a red flag for snake oil, over-hyped, under-performing garbage, so much so that it’s become a punchline. Anytime that phrase is seen, it’s assumed that the product is a joke - quite possibly doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>Since Snowden dropped his document cache, opening the world’s eyes to what’s been going on behind the scenes at what is likely the world’s most sophisticated attacker, NSA-Proof has become the new “military grade encryption” - marketing hype leading to instant ridicule by industry insiders. This phrase isn’t as simple though - the NSA isn’t a single dimensioned threat. So when talking about defenses, you have to think about not just avoiding the NSA, but avoiding the various attack classes they leverage.</p>

<h3>Fighting NSA Programs</h3>

<p>When people talk about resisting the NSA, what exactly does that mean? As the NSA runs many programs, we have to look at the programs to see what could (or couldn’t) be real resistance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora">Tempora</a></strong> (and similar projects) that tap backbone links, siphoning data en mass for later processing. Projects like this gather as much as possible, with no concern for who’s data they are looking at.</p>

<p>These efforts are passive, they see what’s going over the fiber, but without changing it. So encryption, even opportunistic (which I’m <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/02/25/on-opportunistic-encryption/">really not a fan</a> of), prevents them from getting useful data. So TLS is NSA-Proof, from this very specific angle - it prevents them from <strong>passively</strong> collecting this data.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a></strong>, the infamous project whose exact role and function is still being debated. Metadata is king, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/ex-nsa-chief-we-kill-people-based-on-metadata/">metadata kills</a>. Metadata is easier to understand in bulk, and far easier to process than actual content for most (if not all) types of communication. Once you have enough of it, it’s far more valuable than the content it went with.</p>

<p>Want to protect against PRISM? Easy, kill all of the metadata. For a service provider, the less they know, the less they can be forced to hand-over. Email for example, is loaded with useful metadata, data that’s easily mined and correlated. Services and protocols that are being developed to be PRISM resistant are doing so by encrypting as much as possible, and minimizing the exposed metadata.</p>

<p>So, NSA-Proof is possible here as well, in a very specific angle. It’s harder to protect against than something like Tempora, but still doable with the right design.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations">TAO</a></strong> What about TAO, the NSA’s version of the special forces? Guarding against wide-scale NSA data collection is one thing, targeted activities are a different story.</p>

<p>I once suggested a <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2013/09/06/making-android-nsa-proof/">method for making Android NSA-Proof</a> (it involves thermite, so it’s fun too!), and if you are targeted by TAO, that’s probably the best bet. There are ways you can make their job harder, but as long as they can figure out where you are, there’s always the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/inside-the-nsas-leaked-catalog-of-surveillance-magic/">implant</a> option.</p>

<p>So can you be NSA-Proof from TAO? Probably not. You can make your odds better, but if they are willing to put the effort in, sooner or later they’ll win unless you are very well funded, and willing to take extreme measures.</p>

<h3>Marketing Hype</h3>

<p>Many journalists use similar terms, ‘NSA proof’, ‘NSA resistant’, ‘thwarting the NSA’, and a hundred others. While there’s a good chance it’s just more snake oil, it’s possible that there may be <em>some</em> truth to it.</p>

<p>When dealing with an adversary like the NSA - you have to consider which part of the NSA. They are after everyone with mass data collection, which is something that can be fought - with a high likelihood of success. Though as the the targeting becomes more focused, the odds start dropping. Once TAO is involved, only the best funded have any hope of resisting.</p>

<p>If a service claims to be ‘NSA-Proof’ - it could be true, to a limited extent. Such claims really need to be qualified; if a service makes this kind of claim, they should provide information of which programs (or program types) they are trying to resist.</p>

<h3>So, what does NSA resistance actually require?</h3>

<p>This, obviously, isn’t an easy question and depends very much on the nature of the service. Though there are a few high-level things to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong, non-NSA backed crypto primitives. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl</a> because it’s fast, constant-time, secure crypto that doesn’t rely on anything backed by the NSA. To make it easier to use, it’s made portable (and extended) in <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>. I won’t promote anti-NIST FUD, but some things should be questioned, such as the NIST ECC curves.</li>
<li>Minimal metadata. The amount of information that can be extracted from messages should be at a minimum. Anything that’s exposed (username, user ID, public keys, etc.) can be used when collected en mass to begin mapping relationships and undoing the veil of anonymity.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in transit. As with metadata, anything in the clear going over the network can be captured, stored, analyzed - and in targeted cases, altered in various ways. Using TLS is a great start to this, as it removes the option for simple passive monitoring, though it shouldn’t be assumed to be enough. Active attackers can man-in-the-middle the server, passing a forged/stolen certificate. Certificate pinning, and additional layers of encryption help protect against these attacks.</li>
<li>Server knows as little as possible. The more the server knows, the more the provider(s) can divulge - either by court order, or by more clandestine means. Even the simplest HTTP server logs can provide valuable information to such an attacker, especially when combined with other data sources.</li>
<li>Encrypt everything in storage. When at rest, everything should be encrypted - if a device is compromised, it should reveal as little as possible. By encrypting everything based on the user’s password, only the user is able to access the data (though may be by force).</li>
<li>Hide everything. The CIA at least once used a weather application to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/germany-arrest-second-spy-accused-us-cia">hide a communication system</a>; it was only available when looking up weather for a certain city. Such techniques make it harder to spot the use of secure communication tools. This may seem a bit extreme, but there are good reasons to do it.</li>
</ul>


<p>There’s more of course, these are just a few high points. Defending against an adversary that has a huge budget, doesn’t respect international law, has a rubber stamp court, and some of the best technical talent in the world requires - special - measures. Of course, the NSA isn’t the only player; it goes beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>, every major power engages in such activity to some extent.</p>

<p>If you can provide a reasonable degree of protection against PRISM &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court">FISC</a>, then you can expect to have equal odds with other players using the same attacks. Will it actually work? Who knows; there’s a lot that can go wrong, a lot of mistakes that can be made, so many ways a good intentioned developer can turn a secure system into a thin facade that offers no protection. The list above is a starting point, not the final requirements.</p>

<h3>Can it really be achieved?</h3>

<p>Achieving real resistance to illegal surveillance is a huge challenge, but at least some degree of success can be had by taking simple measures. Ensuring that everything possible is encrypted, that all network traffic is encrypted, and the like will make it far more of a challenge for an attacker.</p>

<p>TAO-level resistance probably isn’t realistic, but lower levels are a real option, and should be pursued whenever possible. While calling anything ‘NSA proof’ should be seen as a red flag, there are real techniques to resist the NSA and other agencies that seek to invade the privacy of the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday James B. Comey, the Director of the FBI continued the propaganda campaign against encryption with a fresh batch of lies and misdirection. The FBI has been pushing to add backdoors to cryptosystems around the world - no matter how many people they put at risk in the process. Starting in the 1990’s, the FBI has been at the forefront of trying to make their job easier by endangering the world.</p>

<p>What Comey did today was to lay the foundation for a renewed push for a new, expansive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">CALEA</a> type law that would give <em>governments</em> access - via court orders or surreptitiously, to all of your data. In 2013 they were pushing for <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/calea-ii-risks-of-wiretap-modifications-to-endpoints/">CALEA 2</a>, which would have expanded their ability to secretly access your data in a massive way. Thankfully the Snowden documents put an end to that - at least for awhile.</p>

<p>I use the term governments instead of specifying the US Government very intentionally. Under CALEA, certain systems must be compliant to be sold in the US - so companies add support, and then ship them all over the world instead of supporting two versions. So the FBI’s desire to have easy access to anything they want puts people around the world at risk. But surely nobody would abuse this, right?</p>

<p>In 2004, thanks to support for this type of “lawful intercept” support, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%9305">Vodaphone in Greece was hacked</a> - tapping top government and civil leaders. Who did it still isn’t known, but many suspect that the US Government was behind it. Then there’s <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/">SOMALGET</a>, the NSA program to collect all calls made in the Bahamas. The DEA was given access to their phone systems for the purposes of “lawful intercept” - again, a CALEA compliant setup, which was then used to collect everything they were able to get. These are just two high profile examples, there are many cases where researchers have found flaws in these systems, making them easy prey.</p>

<p>For years, it’s been made clear that such backdoors were disasters - and it’s not just CALEA compliance either. There’s the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a> which would encrypt voice calls, but allow the government to easily listen in - but thanks to fatal flaws, anyone else could as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to this, pretty much everybody agrees that backdoors are a bad idea, so the FBI had a great idea - call it something else!</p>

<h3>A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p>Comey, deciding that he shouldn’t have to deal with reality, and that the best way to address the public was misdirection:</p>

<blockquote><p>We aren’t seeking a back-door approach. We want to use the front door, with clarity and transparency, and with clear guidance provided by law.</p></blockquote>


<p>And by “front door”, he means some new backdoor into everything.</p>

<p>He wants the ability to decrypt data, without having to get information from the suspect; which means adding a backdoor to systems, to allow them - and likely many others to get in. This is no different than the disastrous Clipper chip idea.</p>

<p>The FBI is trying to misdirect the public, lead them to believe in some magical, secure backdoor that is abuse-proof. But when such an idea is being pushed by an organization that has so much abuse and illegal activity in its history - should anyone trust what they say?</p>

<h3>Putting enforcement first</h3>

<p>At one point Comey said something that I found shocking:</p>

<blockquote><p>Are we so mistrustful of government—and of law enforcement—that we are willing to let bad guys walk away&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>If you read the US Constitution, this is answered for him - in many places it is made clear, it’s better to let a criminal walk free than to infringe on the rights of the innocent. Preserving the rights of the people trumps everything.</p>

<p>For law enforcement, this isn’t about justice, or the rule of law - this is about their power, their ability to get what they want, when they want it. If they put people in harms way in the process, that’s a price they are willing to let the public pay.</p>

<h3>Only one government?</h3>

<p>In the discussions about this, one major point keeps being missed - this isn’t just about the US Government, but about the governments all around the world. If companies are forced to add backdoors to products for the US market, you can bet that same backdoor will be shipped to every country they work in.</p>

<p>So the danger is global - but as this is something that can be used for intelligence, as CALEA has been used for in the past, I’m sure this fact hasn’t escaped the attention of planners at the NSA. For the NSA, a CALEA 2 style law would give them easy access to expend their already vast - and illegal - collection operations. It would be a dream come true.</p>

<p>There’s also another international component to this issue - many major tech companies operate in several countries, making them subject to local courts. What happens when they receive a court order for access to this backdoor and a gag order, to prevent them from talking about it? Suddenly American data will be at risk from foreign powers.</p>

<p>There are so many issues opened up when backdoors are added, that one could talk for days and still not cover all the ways it could be abused.</p>

<h3>Lies and mistrust</h3>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps it’s time to suggest that the post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far in one direction—in a direction of fear and mistrust.</p></blockquote>


<p>It seems that Comey is surprised that people don’t trust the government, after lies, deception, and violations of law are revealed. How shocking.</p>

<p>The US Government has failed to uphold the Constitution, and technology companies have stepped up to provide a level of protection in the face of a Government that has ignored its obligations. I’m sure that the FBI would love to go back the old days - where we assume the government is doing the right thing while secretly violating the Constitution and ignoring international law. Anything to give them more power and control.</p>

<h3>The New Crypto Wars</h3>

<p>In the 1990s, the first crypto war was fought, and many believed that the public had won. What we are seeing is, without question, that a new war has started. Apple’s decision to change the way they encrypt phones wasn’t what started it - the writing had been on the walls for some time, it was just the ammunition they were waiting to go on the attack.</p>

<p>Those that work with cryptography daily fighting to protect users, while the government is busy trying to protect what they want, over the rights and protection of the people. Expect it to get ugly.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a fight, and what happens in the next year or two will be critical. If the FBI wins, privacy dies.</p>

<p><em>(Sorry for the ranty nature of this post - it’s an issue I feel strongly about, and something that we must take action on.)</em></p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, <a href="http://www.brandonw.net/">Brandon Wilson</a> and I gave a talk on BadUSB at DerbyCon - I wrote some <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2014/10/02/making-badusb-work-for-you-derbycon/">about it yesterday</a>. Yesterday, Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/code-published-for-unfixable-usb-attack/">published</a> an article on the talk, kicking off several others - only the authors of the Wired and <a href="http://threatpost.com/badusb-attack-code-publicly-disclosed">Threatpost</a> articles contacted us for input.</p>

<p>There has been some questions raised as to the responsibility of releasing the code - so I want to take a few minutes to talk about what we released, why, and what the risks actually are.</p>

<h2>What we released.</h2>

<p>We released a two patches to the existing (v1.03.53) firmware for the Phison 2251-03, and a minimal custom firmware for that same chip.</p>

<p><strong>The Patches</strong></p>

<p>First, let me briefly describe the patches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden Partition - A patch to create a second hidden partition, to show that data can be hidden, and not easily accessed unless you know the trick.</li>
<li>Password Bypass - A patch to modify the password protection mechanism to force the password to fixed value; so that any password will be accepted. Must be applied before the password is set by the user.</li>
</ul>


<p>The second patch does defeat a “security” mechanism on the device, though given that the patch must be applied before the password is set - it’s not a huge risk to users. We intentionally focused on changing behavior instead of adding composite devices, to show that the is more complex than what was displayed at the Black Hat talk.</p>

<p>So we’ve bypassed one security feature, and added a new feature.</p>

<p>The patches were carefully selected to make the point, while not endangering users.</p>

<p><strong>The Custom Firmware</strong></p>

<p>The custom firmware acts a HID device, typing out a pre-programmed payload when inserted to a computer. This is anything but new - this can be done with a <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">USB Rubber Ducky</a>, a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>, or a number of other devices.</p>

<p>This was released to prove the point that the device could be reprogrammed to be something completely different. If this is a new threat to anyone - they are very out of the loop.</p>

<p><strong>The Tools</strong></p>

<p>We also released a few tools that we developed to apply patches and to make our lives easier during the effort. Most of what they do is available in other tools from Phison or the device manufactures; we built the tools we needed, so we didn’t have to use third-party tools or deal with the limitations of those tools.</p>

<h2>What we DIDN’T release</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about what was released, let’s talk about what it isn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Self replication</strong> - There’s no self replication code anywhere, while it’s possible that it could be done, and we’ve talked about how to do it - it won’t be released.</p>

<p>I am confident that we (Brandon and I) could build a system that would infect PCs, then infect a significant percentage of thumb drives, and then infect other PCs - but, and this is a <em>big</em> but - what we released doesn’t make that easier in any significant way.</p>

<p>Your average script kiddy will never be able to do it; there’s only a small number of people that would be able to do the work needed to be able to pull it off - those people could already do it before we released what we did.</p>

<p>The threat of this happening is the same as it has always been.</p>

<p><strong>Malware</strong> - There’s nothing malicious about what we’ve released here. While we did release a patch to modify the password protection feature - that’s all it does. It doesn’t modify data, infect computers with anything, or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>It changes the way a feature works. That’s it. This is a change that anyone with the required skills could have made - by making it public, we are raising awareness that users shouldn’t blindly trust.</p>

<p><strong>The end of USB as we know it</strong> - Nothing, nothing, that we’ve released has suddenly made new attacks possible. The USB specification allows composite devices to do unexpected things. USB devices (thumb drives or otherwise) that allow anyone to update the firmware without any checks, means that anything can potentially be reprogrammed to change functionality or become malicious.</p>

<p>All of these things have been true long before we released the first line of code. Anyone that believes otherwise doesn’t understand the technology.</p>

<p><strong>An unfixable issue that will end the world</strong> - While there isn’t quick fix for this, things can be improved quite a bit. We released simple code, that proves the issue, draws attention to the fact that users need to be more careful, while being careful to not cause more harm than good in the process.</p>

<p>This isn’t earth shattering. Anyone that thinks that it is, should probably give up and go live in a cave.</p>

<h2>The Risks</h2>

<p>What are the real risks here - what does this expose users to that it didn’t in the past?</p>

<p>Writing code for these devices is far from easy, especially when trying to patch the existing firmware. It’s not something that just anyone can jump into - while we have made it easier for people to apply simple patches and provided some insight to the process, these aren’t the patches that will lead to a firmware based worm or something of that nature - these are the type of patches that will make small changes to existing features, or add simple new features. Even then, it’s time consuming and difficult work.</p>

<p>So, to do anything still requires a lot of knowledge and skill - in general, as I said earlier, the kind of people that have what it takes to do this, could do it regardless of our release.</p>

<p>If a person (or group) was so inclined to take one of these devices and make it truly malicious - it’s unlikely that our research would have an impact.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that by releasing this code, the risk to the average user isn’t increased at all over what it already was.</p>

<h2>Why release?</h2>

<p>Device manufactures were quick to dismiss the “BadUSB” threat - on one hand, what was presented at Black Hat was possible via other means, so wasn’t really a new threat - but they showed no indication of trying to address the issues under their control.</p>

<p>For years devices have been sold with updatable firmware, but with no security checks at all - we had two goals with the release of the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>User awareness - As long as users implicitly trust devices, attacks will be possible and successful.</li>
<li>Push device manufactures to implement signed updates.</li>
</ul>


<p>While it will take years for any changes made by device manufactures to have an impact because of the number of devices in circulation now - if they keep ignoring the issue, then it will never be improved.</p>

<p>In doing this, we haven’t broken the security of these devices, but made it clear that it isn’t existent. If anyone is upset that we’ve removed the obscurity that had “protected” these devices - then to them I’m sorry that they understand so little that they believe that it’s real protection.</p>

<p>Part of the reason we released the “hidden partition” patch was to show that this can be used to add new features, that can add value in certain cases.</p>

<h2>The Full Disclosure debate</h2>

<p>When we started on this, we were concerned that this was being touted as a new threat, yet for defenders there was no way they could even test it, much less develop defense techniques.</p>

<p>So not only do we have something that defenders can’t test, we have something that the device manufactures are downplaying or ignoring. This is the setup for the classic full disclosure debate.</p>

<p>The first question that we asked ourselves, before we wrote the first line of code, is what is best for users? To allow the status quo to continue, or to expand the research into new directions and publish - to help make users aware and provide defenders something to work with.</p>

<p>The answer we came up with, is that we could develop patches that would clearly communicate the issue, without causing undue harm to end users.</p>

<p>In the end, looking at what we intended to release, what could be done that wouldn’t have been possible before that (which is fairly minimal), and the potential benefit - we felt, and still do, that full disclosure was appropriate.</p>

<p>In everything we’ve done, the priority has been protecting users - any media report that indicates otherwise is ill-informed, and providing bad information to the public.</p>

<h2>Breaking out of the echo chamber</h2>

<p>Given that the issue was so well known, the amount of attention - positive and negative - that this has received has really surprised us. It’s too common that when something like this is released it stays within the infosec echo chamber - this has broken out far more than I expected.</p>

<p>Most of the negative feedback has been from people and organizations that are well outside of the echo chamber - reminding me of just how ignorant the public can be when it comes to technical issues.</p>

<p>There are times that I wonder why we work so hard to protect these people.</p>

<h2>Has this been blown out of proportion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
