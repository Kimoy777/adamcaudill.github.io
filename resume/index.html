  <h2>About Me</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am passionate about my work - it&#8217;s not simply a job.</li>
<li>I want to work where my skills are challenged and I can learn new things.</li>
<li>I don’t believe in giving up or settling for &#8220;good enough&#8221; – I demand better than that of myself.</li>
<li>I consider myself extremely lucky to be paid to write and break code; it’s both a hobby and profession for me.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>Code: For the last few years I’ve been working in primarily in C# and VB, before that much of my time was spent with PHP; for personal &amp; open source projects I&#8217;m focusing on Ruby. I know my way around C, Java, Python and perhaps a few others, but not well enough to claim any expertise.</p>

<p>Security: I have a knack for breaking things; I leverage my knowledge of developers to choose approaches that others miss. I enjoy system analysis and reverse engineering - both desktop and mobile. My free time is often occupied with independent research, and I&#8217;ve discovered issues in numerous products.</p>

<p>Source Control: I’m familiar with Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. I’ve used SourceSafe and CVS, but I’d rather forget those.</p>

<p>Operating systems / software: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu &amp; Backtrack primarily), and OSX. Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop &amp; Dreamweaver, Fiddler, Wireshark, Eclipse. Metasploit, w3af, soapUI, and various other tools.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p><strong>I am currently</strong> the Application Development Manager at Advanced Call Center Technologies, LLC in Johnson City, TN; I have been with the company since December of 2005.
I currently manage a team of nine developers, both local and remote.  My responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pen-testing applications prior to deployment.</li>
<li>Ensuring compliance with security standards.</li>
<li>Designing, and reviewing other developer’s designs for system architectures.</li>
<li>Mentoring new developers.</li>
<li>Auditing implementations to ensure compliance with various certifications (PCI-DSS, ISO 27002, SSAE 16), as well as client security policies.</li>
<li>Designing application architectures and managing implementations.</li>
<li>Developing applications and tools in C#.</li>
</ul>


<p>During my time here, I believe I have achieved many things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attitude change to think about quality and security first – instead of &#8220;just fix it later.&#8221;</li>
<li>Led effort to update applications to be compliant with PCI-DSS.</li>
<li>Designed a new internal framework that reduced turn-around time by 20% to 30% for large requests and up to 80% for smaller requests.</li>
<li>Migrated source control away from Visual SourceSafe to Mercurial, and implemented a continuous integration system.</li>
<li>Standardized data access, security, and other sensitive code into a standard library to improve security and consistency.</li>
<li>Replaced various third-party communication/integration libraries with fully-managed custom implementations (digital voice recorder, PBX, Avaya dialer).</li>
<li>Led development of Python/MongoDB system that improved application performance and reduced dependence on Oracle.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>From 2001 to 2005</strong> I worked as an independent contractor and as a co-founder of an ISV. During this time I built a number of interesting systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom e-commerce systems in PHP/MySQL.</li>
<li>Customized ASP/SQL Server commercial e-commerce system.</li>
<li>Various web sites in PHP/MySQL, some simple; some were effectively custom CMSs.</li>
<li>Various desktop software (processing tools, RSS client, IRC client, Gmail client, network monitoring, etc.).</li>
<li>Custom sales system to sell cars on eBay.</li>
</ul>


<p>During this time I also performed security audits on client sites, provided software and hardware support, and various other IT-related functions.</p>

<p><strong>From 2000 to 2002</strong> I worked with a now defunct security research group as a volunteer building new tools and scripts to automate pen-testing. These tools were primarily to speed delivery of exploit payloads to identified potential targets and report results.</p>

<h2>Open Source &amp; Community</h2>

<p>I blog on security and development related topics, and stay engaged with the community via various social services. I was a moderator on what was once the largest forum for Visual Basic developers (XtremeVBTalk.com), and received their highest peer-voted award for knowledge.</p>

<p>I’ve contributed to a number of open source projects, including bbPress, ccsrch, openssl-net, libsodium-net and others. I’ve also managed a few open source projects – the most interesting of which was a fault-tolerant load balancing system for an IRC network that provided much better leveling that DNS round-robin could.</p>

<p>I founded the BSides Knoxville security conference, and the Underhanded Crypto Contest.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>From 2001 to 2003 I attended Florida Metropolitan University in Melbourne Florida working towards a degree in Computer Information Science. I completed all major-related classes with a 4.0 GPA, and I received multiple Dean’s &amp; President’s List awards during my time there. Unfortunately I did not complete the program due to a family illness.</p>

  <p><img src="https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49e14cf9f67c48aad082dec4f106f19a?size=250" class="aligncenter"></p>
  <p>I am an independant security researcher and software developer with more than 15 years of experience. I primarily focus on application security, secure communications, and cryptography, though often research new areas if I get too bored. I write about my research and security in general, development and software design, and whatever hobby has my attention at the moment.</p>
